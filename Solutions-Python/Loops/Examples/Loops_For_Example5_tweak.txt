# Revised Pseudo-Code:
#
# Import the code features that allow remote file access
# Open the file from Uniprot
#
# Read the first Line of the file (into the variable Line)
#
# While the file is not exhausted (i.e. Line is not empty)
#     Print the current line (without decoding or explicit Newline)
#     Read the next line of the file (into the variable Line)
#
# Tidily close the remote file
