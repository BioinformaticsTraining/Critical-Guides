# Pseudo-Code:
# ============
# 
# Define acceptable Uppercase Values for Yes and No
#
# Ask the Question, save the response as Upper Case
#
# Respond appropriately according to the Value of the Response
#

# Construct strings of Valid uppercase Y/N responses
# Each response bracketed by '-'s to avoid partial matches

Valid_YES = "-Y-YES-AFFIRMATIVE-QUITE-ABSOLUTELY-"
Valid_NO  = "-N-NO-NEGATIVE-NEVER-I BEG TO DIFFER-"

# Ask Question and make response upper case
# Bracket upper case respose with '-'s

Response = '-' + input("Would you agree that today is a splendid day? ").upper() + '-'

# Check response and react appropriately

if   Response in Valid_YES:
    print("So very glad you agree dear chap!")
elif  Response in Valid_NO:
    print("I am mortified that you cannot see the splendour that surrounds thee!")
else:
    print("You answer neither Yes not No? Maybe you cannot make your mind up?")
