# Pseudo-Code:
# ============
# 
# Define acceptable Uppercase Values for Yes and No
#
# Ask the Question, save the response as Upper Case
#

# Construct tuples of Valid uppercase Y/N responses

Valid_YES = ('Y','YES','AFFIRMATIVE','QUITE','ABSOLUTELY')
Valid_NO  = ('N','NO','NEGATIVE','NEVER','I BEG TO DIFFER')

# Ask Question and make response upper case

Response = input("Would you agree that today is a splendid day? ").upper()

# Check response and react appropriately

if   Response in Valid_YES:
    print("So very glad you agree dear chap!")
elif  Response in Valid_NO:
    print("I am mortified that you cannot see the splendour that surrounds thee!")
else:
    print("You answer neither Yes not No? Maybe you cannot make your mind up?")
