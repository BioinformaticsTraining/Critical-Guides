        <h2>Objectives, Structure, Prerequisites</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <div>
          <p>To provide a gentle introduction to writing simple
             <b>Python</b> programs.
          </p>

          <p>A major objective is to develop an
             understanding of "<b>Programming</b>", rather than
             simply learning to "<b>Code in Python</b>".
          </p>

          <p>The design of
             <b>Algorithms</b>, rather than simply generating code to
             solve trivial <b>Exercises</b>, has been emphasised.
          </p>

          <p>I am unsure of the degree to which I have succeeded
             in this goal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        
        <div>
          <p>Primarily, <b>Biologists</b> with
             <b>No Programming Background</b>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Access</h3>

        <div>
          <p>This tutorial is designed to be used
             without supervision. Barring
             a couple of <b>Socrative Quizzes</b> that should be
             possible now.
          </p>

          <p>When complete, the whole thing will be available
             via <b>github</b> for any who might find it of use.
          </p>

          <p>I also intend to use this tutorial as training
             material for live, "<b>Classroom Based</b>",
             training when
             that seems appropriate (broadly whenever the offer
             of free travel to an interesting venue
             presents itself).
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>As a <p id="Start_Time"></p>swift search of the <b>INTERNET</b> will confirm,
             there are many fine <b>Python Tutorials</b>
             freely available. Amongst which is this

        <h3>Structure</h3>
          
        <div>
          <p>I have attempted a series of topics, offering
             <b>Explanation</b> (<b>Text</b> and <b>Video</b>),
             <b>Examples</b> and <b>Exercises</b>, to lead the
             user to a level of competence that should enable
             the design and implementation using <b>Python</b>
             of solutions to simple problems.
          </p>

          <p>I have divided these topics into a number of

        <h3>Assumptions</h3>
          
        <div>
        
          <p>
		          I assume you are using some reasonably
		          current flavour of <b>Linux</b> not too unlike <b>Unbuntu</b>.
		          If you are not, it should affect very little once
		          you are actually using writing <b>Python</b>. You might
		          just occasionally have to think laterally when talking
		          directly to the <b>Operating System</b> (for example, when
		          downloading example files and putting them somewhere
		          they can be accessed by your code).
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using <b>Firefox</b>, set to display
		          text files in the browser. Irritatingly there
		          seems to be no browser that behaves itself as it should <b>100%</b>!
		          Even <b>Firefox</b> required some bizarre manipulations (of my
		          data/code files) to play nicely!
		          I expect you could cope with any browser
		          that is convenient to you, I simply suggest that
		          <b>Firefox</b> might give you the easiest ride.
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using
		          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython"
		           target="_blank"><b>CPython</b></a>, which is the default
		          implementation of <b>Python</b>, written in <b>C</b>.
		          I imagine you are, no need to check as all the practical
		          elements of this tutorial should work fine what
		          ever you are using. Only some of the background
		          discussion will be specific to <b>CPython</b>
		          (particularly with regard to <b>extensibility</b> and the like)
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using <b>Python 3.6</b> or better.
		          If so, everything will work fine. If you are are using
		          an earlier version of <b>Python 3</b>, that should be good enough.
		          Just a few things might not be quite as described
		          (particularly the ordering of <b>Dictionaries</b>). If you
		          are using <b>Python 2</b>, you will find significant
		          differences to the extent I would advise you to
		          update you <b>Python</b> installation.
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          <b>Python 3</b> was introduced in <b>2008</b>
		          and so <b>Python 2</b>
		          has been "obsolete" for <b>10 years</b> now.
		          As <b>Python 3</b>
		          is significantly different to <b>Python 2</b>, there has
		          been an understandable reluctance for people
		          maintaining substantial volumes of <b>Python 2</b> code to
		          move to <b>Python 3</b>. However, teaching a
		          new generation of programmers to use a Language
		          that has not been current for a <b>decade</b> and from
		          which support will soon be withdrawn
		          (<b>First day of 2020</b>)
		          does not seem to be too sensible.
		          Accordingly. this tutorial presents <b>Python 3</b>
		          (unlike a number of other training programs
		          you might find on the web).

        <h2>Preparing to investigate Python Commands</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>In order to investigate the wonders of <b>Python</b>,
             it is essential to first to set up your computing
             environment in a suitable fashion.
          </p>

          <p>Essentially, this means readying the software that
             processes <b>Python</b> commands for action.
          </p>

          <p>This short section is comprised of a short
             description of the relevant software plus
             instruction on how to set it going in the
             fashion appropriate for the initial stages of
             the tutorial.

              <hh4>The Python Interpreter.</hh4>
            </span>
          </summary>

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              The <b>Python Interpreter</b> is the program
              that reads your <b>Python code</b>, and
              instructs the computer to obey. If you are
              very lucky, the computer sometimes
              actually does what you intended!<br><br>

              You can use the <b>Python Interpreter</b> in two
              very different ways:<br>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Interactively</b> - great for running
                  scripts one line at a time, for testing
                  out ideas or new commands.<br><br>

                  Using the <b>Python Interpreter</b>
                  interactively is rather like using a calculator
                  in fact.<br><br>

                  If the <b>Python Interpreter</b> is started
                  interactively, it remains active having completed
                  a task(waiting for the
                  next interactive command) until explicitly
                  told to go away!
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-interactively</b> - in which the
                  <b>Python Interpreter</b> is started to run an
                  entire <b>Python script</b>. Once this
                  is achieved, the <b>Python Interpreter</b>
                  will <b><i>NOT</i></b> wait for
                  further instruction, it will simply close down.

        <h2>Scalar Values</h2>

        <div>
          <p>A <b>Scalar Value</b> is a single item of data.
                </p>

          <p><b>Scalar Data Items</b> can be one of
             a variety of <b>types</b> including:<br>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>int</b> - Integers, that is
                "<b>whole numbers</b>".
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>float</b> - Floating point number,
                that is numbers
                with something after the decimal point.
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>bool</b> - Boolean values, that is
                <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>str</b> - A sequence of <b>Characters</b>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>The two terms <b>type</b> and <b>class</b> are,
             these days, effectively synonyms. I will use
             them interchangeably in this tutorial.
             Historically, there was a significant difference.
             If you are interested, you could look

             but I would not advise doing so at this point.

                  A <b>string</b> is a series (or "ordered set")
                  of <b>characters</b>.<br><br>

                  The number of <b>characters</b> in a
                  <b>string</b> can vary between
                  <b>none</b> and <b>lots</b>.<br><br>

                  <b>characters</b> comprising a
                  <b>string</b> must be enclosed in
                  quotes. Either <b>single</b>
                  or <b>double quotes</b> will work.<br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> ''<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> ""<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> 'a'<br>
                    'a'<br>
                    >>> "a"<br>
                    'a'<br>
                    >>> 'abc'<br>
                    'abc'<br>
                    >>> "abc"<br>
                    'abc'<br>
                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Whether to use <b>single</b> or
                  <b>double quotes</b> is a matter
                  of personal preference. As you
                  see, <b>Python</b> appears to
                  prefer <b>single quotes</b> as it
                  converts all <b>double quotes</b>
                  consistently.<br><br>

                  A common preference is to use
                  <b>single quotes</b> for
                  <b>single characters</b>, or short
                  strings devoid of a significant
                  "<b>Natural Language</b>" message,
                  but to use <b>double quotes</b> for
                  anything that reads coherently as
                  would, for example, a quote from a
                  book.<br><br>

                  sense between <b>strings</b>
                  is '<b>Concatenation</b>'.<br><br>

                  To '<b>Concatenate</b>' two or more
                  <b>Strings</b>, is to join them together to make
                  just one longer <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                  The simplest way to do this is to use
                  the '<b>+</b>' <b>Operator</b>.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> "abc" + "def"<br>
                    'abcdef'<br>

                   'abcdefmnoxyz'<br>

                  <hh5m>Escape Characters</hh5m><br><br>

                  Some characters are difficult to
                  include in a <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                  For example, a character to indicate that
                  a <b>String</b> should be split into more than
                  one line.<br><br>

                  It is no good hitting the
                  <b>Enter Key</b>, that will start a new
                  line in
                  your code, but not in the <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                  The answer is to use <b>Escape characters</b>
                  (also called <b>Escape Sequences</b> or <b>Escape
                  Codes</b>). Click for a
                  <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/list-of-python-escape-sequence-characters-with-examples"
                   target="_blank"> Full List of the Escape
                  Characters available in Python</a>.<br><br>

                  An <b>Escape Sequence</b> always starts with a
                  <b>backslash</b> ('<b>\</b>'), which
                  indicates that the following
                  <b>Characters(s)</b> are to be assigned a
                  special meaning within the <b>String</b>.
                  For example,
                  the <b>Character</b> needed to insert a
                  <b>newline</b> into
                  a <b>String</b> is <b>Line Feed</b>.
                  The <b>Escape code</b>
                  for <b>Line Feed</b> is <b>\n</b>. So,
                  a <b>Multiple Line
                  String</b> maybe assembled as follows:<br><br>

                  <span class="command13">
                    >>> Multi_String = "A was once an
                    ant,\nTiny,\nBusy,\nSpeedy,\nShiny\n
                    In the groundy\n
                    Little ant!"<br>
                    >>> print (Multi_String)<br>
                    A was once an ant,<br>
                    Tiny,<br>
                    Busy,<br>
                    Speedy,<br>
                    Shiny<br>
                    In the groundy<br>
                    Little ant!<br>

                  <p class="hint">
                    <b>Note:</b> Unfortunately the <b>Interactive
                    Interpreter</b> does not deal properly with
                    <b>Escape Codes</b> directly.<br><br>

                    The easiest way to deal with this problem is to
                    introduce the use of the <b>Built-in function
                    print()</b>
                    to display <b>Strings</b> a little ahead
                    of schedule.
                    <b>print()</b> is more powerful than is
                    implied here, as you will see soon.

                  A rather energetic way to announce methods
                  to isolate <b>Subsets</b> of
                  <b>Strings</b> (<b>substrings</b>
                  if you wish).<br><br>

                  To isolate a single <b>Character</b> of a
                  <b>String</b>, use square brackets enclosing
                  the position of the character required.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> A_Long_String = "The basis of optimism
                    is sheer terror"<br>
                    >>> A_Long_String[1]<br>
                    'h'<br>
                    >>> A_Long_String[0]<br>
                    'T'<br>
                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Good plan, but should not
                  <b>A_Long_String[1]</b>
                  have returned the first letter of this gloomy
                  reflection of
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde"
                   target="_blank">Oscar Wilde</a>?<br><br>

                  In fact, the second letter has been returned
                  due to the tendency for counting to begin
                  at <b>0</b> in computing.<br><br>

                  Indeed! <b>A_Long_String[0]</b> does the
                  trick.<br><br>

                  To "<b>Slice</b>" out a section from a
                  <b>String</b>, you need to use <b>2</b>
                  numbers separated by a <b>colon</b>
                  ('<b>:</b>') in the square brackets.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar = "Be yourself;
                    everyone else is already taken"<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:0]<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:1]<br>
                    'B'<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:2]<br>

                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Notice that the <b>Slice</b> is defined from
                  the first position to be included in the
                  <b>Slice</b> to the position following the
                  last to be included.<br><br>

                            Easy! Splice from the 5th character to
                            the 40th character.<br><br>

                            Exactly the same output? This time
                            though, the third argument asks
                            explicitly that every character
                            (stepping along the string <b>1</b>
                            character at a time) be selected for
                            inclusion in the <b>Splice</b>.<br><br>

                            As no explicit "step" argument was
                            offered in the previous example,
                            <b>1</b> was assumed and so the result

                            requested and the wise sentiments of
                            <b>Oscar</b> become more than a

                            Negative <b>Arguments</b> refer to
                            positions counting from the end of
                            the <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                            We cannot start from <b>0</b> this
                            time as that is already reserved for
                            the first position, so
                            <b>Oscar_Again[-1]</b> is the very
                            last <b>Character</b> of the quote,
                            which is an '<b>h</b>'.<br><br>

                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2]</b> has to be
                            the next <b>Character</b> in, which
                            is a '<b>c</b>'.<br><br>

                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2:-1]</b> is also
                            just '<b>c</b>'. Remember the second
                            <b>Argument</b> refers to the
                            position beyond the last one included
                            in the slice.<br><br>

                            So, maybe <b>Oscar_Again[-2:0]</b>
                            will take me to the end of the
                            <b>String</b>? But no!!! Position
                            <b>0</b> is the first <b>Character</b>,
                            so <b>Oscar_Again[-2:0]</b> is
                            impossible and therefore returns
                            the <b>Empty String</b>.<br><br>

                            To slice to the end, using negative
                            indices, requires that the end
                            <b>Argument</b> be omitted, as in
                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2:]</b>. The
                            <b>Default Value</b> is the end of
                            the <b>String</b>, so all is well.
                            Something a little uncomfortable
                            about this? But ... it works.<br><br>

                            The point of these two examples is
                            to make explicit how one has to
                            provide the start at end points of

                            when using negative indices.<br><br>

                            I am not quite sure why, but this
                           causes me some mental anguish. I get

                  Using the Python feature '<b>in</b>',
                  it is possible to test for the presence
                  of one <b>String</b> within another.
                  For example, examining the inspirational
                  boast of the White Queen to a
                  doubting Alice:<br><br>

                  <span class="command15">
                    >>> Alice = "Why, sometimes I've believed
                    as many as six impossible things before
                    breakfast"<br>
                    >>> "impossible" in Alice<br>
                    True<br>
                    >>> "impossible" not in Alice<br>

                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Clearly, '<b>not in</b>' can be used to test for
                  the absence of a <b>substring</b>.<br><br>

                  A <b>Conditional Expression</b> is a
                  <b>Statement</b> that is either
                  <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>. That is,
                  a <b>Statement</b> whose <b>value</b>
                  is of type <b>bool</b>.<br><br>

                  For example, in <b>Python</b>,
                  "<b>6 == 6</b>" reads "<b>6 is equal
                  to 6</b>", which is generally considered
                  to be <b>True</b>, whereas, "<b>6 != 6</b>",
                  which reads "<b>6 is not equal to 6</b>"
                  is accepted by most as mendacious!<br><br>

                  The magnitude of a <b>character</b>
                  (and so a <b>character string</b>) is
                  determined by the numeric value used to
                  represent it in the computer
                  (typically its <b>ASCII code</b>,
                  more later).<br><br>

                  For purely <b>alphabetic strings</b>,
                  the order is simply <b>standard

                  As previously mentioned, <b>Scalar Values</b>
                  of type <b>bool</b> can have just one
                  of two possible values,
                  <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.<br><br>

                  <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> are represented
                  in the computer by <b>Integers</b>
                  (<b>Scalar Values</b> of the type
                  <b>int</b>). Some arrangement of this
                  sort is imperative as
                  <b><i>everything</i></b> is a number
                  inside a computer,
                  if you look hard enough.<br><br>

                  So, in a very practical sense,
                  <b>bools</b>
                  are a <b>sub-class</b> (<b>sub-type</b>) of
                  the <b>Python class</b>
                  (<b>type</b>) <b>int</b>.<br><br>

                  <b><i>Quite arbitrarily</i></b>, as
                  <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> have no
                  logical association with any numeric
                  value, <b>True</b> is represented as the
                  <b>Integer 1</b> and <b>False</b> as the
                  <b>Integer 0</b>.<br><br>

                  You <b><i>could</i></b> replace <b>True</b>
                  and <b>False</b> in your code by <b>1</b>
                  and <b>0</b>, but why would you ever wish
                  to???? It would merely obscure and would
                  represent extremely poor style.<br><br>

                  You <b><i>could</i></b> do arithmetic
                  with <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> and they
                  would act as if they were the <b>Integers
                  1</b> and <b>0</b> respectively. But why
                  on earth would you want to??? Not only

                        <b>Python</b> sets out to be "lean
                        and mean". It does not try to offer
                        <b>builtin</b> functionality for
                        everything,
                        preferring instead the "efficiencies" of
                        simplicity. The user is expected to fill
                        any gaps.<br><br>

                        Generally a defensible policy, but just
                        occasionally one does wonder if
                        <b>Python</b>'s designers might not have
                        taken a tiny step to far?<br><br>

                        In this case, no <b>Exclusive OR
                        Operator</b> (normally offered as
                        "<b>xor</b>")? I wonder why?<br><br>

                        Just in case, were <b>xor</b> included,
                        the interpretation would be:<br><br>

                        It is a bit clumsy, but it reads
                        nicely (if you take it slowly), which
                        I think is very important.<br><br>

                      Probably the best way to compensate
                      for the omission of <b>xor</b> is
                      to extend
                      <b>Python</b> by bolting
                      on extra functionalities available
                      from various sources. We will cover
                      how to do that very soon.<br><br>

                      Or ... you could write your own

                      to ... later.<br><br>

                      In the meantime, the solution that
                      I like the best uses only what we
                      have discussed thus far. There are

                      solutions that require tricks we
                      have not covered, but I would still

            <b>print()</b> ... later.

        <h2>Scalar Variables</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>A <b>Scalar Variable</b> can be thought of as a named
             "<i>Container</i>" in which a <b>Scalar Value</b>
             might be stored.
          </p>

          <p><b>Scalar Variables</b> are typed according to
             the <b>Scalar Value</b> they are assigned.
             That is, a <b>Scalar Variable</b> takes on the same
             <b>type</b> (or <b>class</b>) as the <b>Scalar Value</b>
             it "contains".
          </p>

          <p>Loosely, with only <b>Scalar Values</b> we
             could just do "<b>Arithmetic</b>", adding
             <b>Scalar Variables</b> enables "<b>Algebra</b>".
          </p>
          
          <p>The discussion that follows applies
             (unless explicitly stated
             otherwise) not just to <b>Scalar Variables</b>, but to
             <b>Variables</b> that "contain" the more complex
             entities that will
             be covered later in this tutorial.
          </p>

          <p>Again, these entities will be
             investigated using the <b>Python
             Interpreter</b> interactively.

              There is no requirement to explicitly
              <b>declare</b> (<b>create</b>)
              <b>Variables</b> in <b>Python</b>.
              A <b>Variable</b> is created the moment
              it is first assigned a <b>Value</b>. Until it
              is <b>assigned</b> a <b>Value</b>,
              a <b>Variable</b> does not exist.<br><br>

              <span class="command">

                >>>
              </span><br><br>

              There is no requirement to explicitly assign a
              <b>type</b> to a <b>Variable</b>. It will assume
              the <b>type</b> of the <b>Value</b> it is
              assigned.<br><br>

              The <b>type</b> of a <b>Variable</b> is not fixed.
              It will change to match the <b>type</b> of each
              <b>Value</b> it is assigned<br><br>

              <span class="command">
                >>> b = 2<br>
                >>> b<br>
                2<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = 2.7<br>
                >>> b<br>
                2.7<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'float'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = True<br>
                >>> b<br>
                True<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'bool'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = "I am a very nice string"<br>
                >>> b<br>
                'I am a very nice string'<br>

                &lt;class 'str'&gt;<br>
                >>>
              </span><br>

              <p class="hint"><b>Note</b>: <b>type()</b> is
                 a <b>Python Built-in Function</b>. That is,
                 a facility that <b>Python</b> considers to be
                 of great sufficient "importance" to be offered,
                 "ready coded", as part of the language.<br><br>

                We will discuss <b>Built-in Functions</b>, and

                I introduce <b>type()</b>, ahead of time as it
                serves a purpose useful here and now.<br><br>

                <b>type()</b> takes a <b>Variable</b> as an
                <b>Argument</b>, which is placed between the
                <b>brackets ()</b>, and it returns the <b>type</b>
                (or <b>class</b>) of that <b>Variable</b>.

                        <p>A trivial question to start?
                        </p>

                        <p>A single '<b>=</b>', in <b>Python</b>,
                           is used for <b>Assignment
                           Statements</b>. So:<br><br>

                          <span class="command">
                            a=6
                          </span><br><br>

                           reads as "<i><b>Assign</b> the
                           <b>Integer Value</b> '<b>6</b>'
                           to the <b>Variable</b> called
                           '<b>a</b>'</i>".
                        </p>

                        <p>But <b>Python</b> also needs to be
                           able to say "<i>is equal to</i>"
                           when constructing <b>Conditional
                           Expressions</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Trying to use a
                           single '<b>=</b>' again would be
                           ambiguous and so unacceptable.
                        </p>

                        <p>The <b>Python</b> solution is to use
                           a double '<b>=</b>' ('<b>==</b>'), as
                           you have already seen when looking
                           at <b>bool type Scalar Values</b>).
                        </p>

                        <p>So:<br><br>

                          </span><br><br>

                           reads "<i>'<b>a</b>'
                           is equal to '<b>6</b>'</i>", which is
                           either <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>,
                           that is, a <b>bool Data type</b>.
                        </p>

                          >>> a = 6<br>

              Only <b>Alphanumeric Characters</b> and
              <b>Underscore</b> (<b>A-Z</b>,
              <b>a-z</b>, <b>0-9</b>, and <b>_</b> )
              may be used.
              <b>Variable Names</b> cannot begin with

              Beginning a <b>Variable Name</b>
              with a <b>Numeric</b> seems quite harmless?
              But I suppose it is an easy strategy to
              discourage (accidental or otherwise)
              use of really silly <b>ALL</b> numeric

              <b>Python Reserves</b> certain words
              for particular purposes. Such words are,
              with breath draining originality, called
              <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list"
               target="_blank"><b>Reserved Words</b></a>.<br><br>

              Clearly, <b>Reserved Words</b> can only serve
              their one anointed purpose and so are not
              available for use as <b>Variable Names</b>.<br><br>

              There are lots of <b>Python Reserved Words</b>.
              However, thus far, we have only met <b>four</b>.
              They are the <b>Boolean Operators</b>
              '<b>and</b>' '<b>or</b>' '<b>not</b>', plus
              '<b>in</b>' (used to test the
              presence of
              <b>Strings</b> within <b>Strings</b>).<br><br>

              Any attempt to use these (or any other
              <b>Reserved Word</b>) as a <b>Variable
              Name</b> would result in stern rebuke from
              the <b>Python Interpreter</b>.<br><br>

              <span class="command">

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and = 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> or = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> not = 3<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not = 3<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^
                <br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> in = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> xor = 4<br>
                >>> xor<br>
                4<br>
                >>>
              </span><br><br>

              Note that, <b>xor</b> is not a <b>Reserved Word</b>,
              though some might wonder why not? So, <b>xor</b>
              works as a <b>Variable Name</b> just fine.<br><br>

                    The "Eagle Eyed" amongst you might have
                    noticed that the
                    '<b>^</b>' attempting to pinpoint the
                    position of the
                    <b>Error</b> points to the <b>Boolean

                    case of '<b>and</b>' & '<b>or</b>',
                    but it points at the
                    '<b>=</b>' sign for the
                    <b>Error</b> associated with
                    '<b>not</b>'? Can you explain why?<br>

                    <details class="answer">
                    <summary><span class="anssum">Answer.</span>

                      <div class="answer">

                        The reason for the difference is
                        that '<b>not</b>'
                        can be a <b>Unary Operator</b>.
                        This is not so
                        for either '<b>and</b>' or
                        '<b>or</b>'.<br><br>

                        That is to say, "<b>not True</b>"
                        is semantically
                        meaningful. It means
                        "<b>False</b>".<br><br>

                          >>>
                        </span><br><br>

                        Similarly, "<b>not False</b>" is
                        semantically
                        meaningful. It means "<b>True</b>".<br><br>

                        <span class="command">
                          >>> not False<br>
                          True<br>
                          >>>
                        </span><br><br>

                        But "<b>or True</b>", "<b>and True</b>"?
                        These are both nonsense.<br><br>

                        <span class="command">
                          >>> or True<br>

                          line 1<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or True<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                          SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                          >>> and True<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;",
                          line 1<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and True<br>

                        So, by the time the <b>Interpreter</b>
                        (working from <b>left</b> to <b>right</b>)
                        gets to the end
                        of the <b>Boolean</b> '<b>and</b>'
                        or '<b>or</b>',

                        However, if the first word is
                        '<b>not</b>', it just
                        could be a legal use of a
                        <b>Reserved Word</b>! Maybe
                        an attempt to display "<b>not True</b>",
                        "<b>not False</b>", or
                        "<b>not x</b>", where '<b>x</b>'
                        is any numeric value (or even a
                        string!?).<br><br>

                        Remember, as far as the computer is
                        concerned, <b>False</b> is the
                        same as <b>0</b> and any other
                        numeric value is seen as
                        <b>True</b>.<br><br>

                        A <b>String Value</b> for '<b>x</b>'
                        works because
                        <b>Python</b> arbitrarily dictates
                        that <b>ANY</b> string, when used
                        as a <b>Conditional Expression</b>,
                        will be interpreted as
                        <b>True</b>, except the empty
                        string (<b>""</b>) which will be considered
                        <b>False</b>.<br><br>

                    It has been established that

                    cannot be used as a <b>Variable Name</b>?

                       is the Function,
                       not <b>type</b>.<br><br>

                       <b>type()</b> is only recognised
                       by the <b>Interpreter</b>
                       as inviolate when it appears
                       with <b>Parentheses</b>
                       in place (ready to enclose the <b>Function
                       Argument(s)</b>). Just the
                       word <b>type</b> is
                       <b><i>NOT</i></b> special at all,
                       and so available for
                       use as a <b>Variable Name</b>.<br><br>

                        </span><br><br>

                      So, the simple answers to the questions
                      posed are:<br><br>

                      <b>True</b>, <b>False</b> and
                      <b>None</b> are all <b>Reserved Words</b>.
                      So I lied, we have met <b>7
                      Reserved Words</b> so far!<br><br>

                      <b>True</b>, <b>False</b> and
                      <b>None</b> are all unavailable for use
                      as <b>Variable Names</b>.<br><br>

                      But, look at the <b>Error Message</b>
                      this time. It specifies the reason
                      for disallowing <b>True</b>,
                      <b>False</b>, <b>None</b> is
                      that they
                      are <b>Keywords</b>?

                      So, what is the difference between a
                      <b>Keyword</b> and a
                      <b>Reserved Word</b>?<br>

                      <p class="hint">In <b>Python</b>,
                         <i>"There is no
                         difference that matters a jot!"
                         </i>, so its fine to skip the
                         next bit if you wish.
                      </p>

                      Essentially, my summary, based on my
                      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1078908/what-is-the-difference-between-keyword-and-reserved-word"
                       target="_blank"> best hit</a> from
                       many google searches, is as follows:<br><br>

                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Keywords</b> have a special
                          meaning in a language, and are
                          part of the <b>Syntax</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Reserved words</b> are words
                          that cannot be used as
                          <b>Variable Names</b> (and similar),
                          because they are <b>Reserved</b>
                          by the <b>Language</b>.
                        </li>
                      </ul><br>

                      OK, I simplify this to:<br><br>
                      <i>"<b>Keywords</b> are words it would
                      be silly to use as <b>Variable Names</b>
                      as they already have already been assigned
                      constant <b>Values</b>.<br><br>
                      
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> are words that the
                      <b>Language</b> has forbidden to be used
                      as <b>Variable Names</b>, for any
                      of a number of reasons."</i><br><br>

                      In <b>Python</b>, <b>Reserved words</b>
                      and <b>Keywords</b> <b>Coincide</b>
                      (that is, all <b>Keywords</b> are
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> and vice versa),
                      which surely has to be sensible?<br><br>
                      
                      The only mystery remaining is why
                      <b>Python</b> makes life mysterious
                      by varying its <b>Error Messages</b>
                      for different types of
                      <b>Keywords</b>? No mystery really,
                      the <b>Interpreter</b> just notices
                      that <b>and</b> and <b>or</b> are
                      both <b>Binary Operators</b> and so
                      cannot be the first word of a
                      command, <b><i>before</i></b> it
                      notices they are also <b>Reserved Words</b>.
                      Strictly speaking, there should
                      be two <b>Error Messages</b>,
                      but the <b>Interpreter</b> is
                      content to rush on once the
                      first terminal failure is detected.<br><br>

                      A <b>Language</b> does
                      not <b><i>have</i></b> to <b>Reserve</b> any
                      <b>Keywords</b>! Why not allow a user
                      to assign any <b>Value</b> he/she wishes
                      to <b>True</b> (and similar) ... and
                      then enjoy the chaos? Older languages
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word"
                       target="_blank">
                      (<b>FORTRAN</b>, <b>PL/1</b>, <b>Algol</b>)
                      have lots of <b>Keywords</b> but no
                      <b>Reserved Words</b></a>!!
                      We believed in "Living life on the edge"
                      in those days!<br><br>

                      It is even possible to have
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> that are not
                      <b>Keywords</b>. A word that is not
                      currently a <b>Keyword</b> might be
                      <b>Reserved</b> because it might be a

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              A single, hopefully obvious, point to be made
              here, about
              <b>Style</b>, rather than <b>Syntax</b>
              or <b>Semantics</b>.<br><br>

              An issue about which the <b>Interpreter</b>
              will not care a jot!
              <b><i>BUT</i></b>, is of great importance if
              you are to write code
              that can be easily understood and maintained
              by others ... or
              even yourself after just a few short months
              (hours! for those
              of you who have achieved a similar level of
              maturity to myself!).<br><br>

              It is vital to construct your code as
              coherently as possible.
              Strategies include:<br>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Copious Comments</b>. Something to
                  which we will return
                  when we write short programs rather
                  than examine single
                  statements with the <b>Interactive
                  Interpreter</b>.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                  Maintaining a prominent <b>Outline</b>
                  of what your code is
                  trying to achieve (<b>pseudo-code</b>?).
                  Again, something to
                  expand upon later.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                  A meaningful choice of <b>Variable Names</b>.
                  It is too
                  tempting to use anonymous single letter
                  <b>Variable Names</b>
                  that convey nothing of their purpose for
                  existence.<br><br>

                  Really just an element of commenting your
                  code adequately,
                  as is trying to avoid enigmatic presentation
                  of data.<br><br>

                  I attempt to demonstrate. Contrast these two
                  code segments
                  of identical raw purpose.<br><br>
