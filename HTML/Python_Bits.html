        <h2>Objectives, Structure, Prerequisites</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <div>
          <p>To provide a gentle introduction to writing simple
             <b>Python</b> programs.
          </p>

          <p>A major objective is to develop an
             understanding of "<b>Programming</b>", rather than
             simply learning to "<b>Code in Python</b>".
          </p>

          <p>The design of
             <b>Algorithms</b>, rather than simply generating code to
             solve trivial <b>Exercises</b>, has been emphasised.
          </p>

          <p>I am unsure of the degree to which I have succeeded
             in this goal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        
        <div>
          <p>Primarily, <b>Biologists</b> with
             <b>No Programming Background</b>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Access</h3>

        <div>
          <p>This tutorial is designed to be used
             without supervision. Barring
             a couple of <b>Socrative Quizzes</b> that should be
             possible now.
          </p>

          <p>When complete, the whole thing will be available
             via <b>github</b> for any who might find it of use.
          </p>

          <p>I also intend to use this tutorial as training
             material for live, "<b>Classroom Based</b>",
             training when
             that seems appropriate (broadly whenever the offer
             of free travel to an interesting venue
             presents itself).
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>As a <p id="Start_Time"></p>swift search of the <b>INTERNET</b> will confirm,
             there are many fine <b>Python Tutorials</b>
             freely available. Amongst which is this

        <h3>Structure</h3>
          
        <div>
          <p>I have attempted a series of topics, offering
             <b>Explanation</b> (<b>Text</b> and <b>Video</b>),
             <b>Examples</b> and <b>Exercises</b>, to lead the
             user to a level of competence that should enable
             the design and implementation using <b>Python</b>
             of solutions to simple problems.
          </p>

          <p>I have divided these topics into a number of

        <h3>Assumptions</h3>
          
        <div>
        
          <p>
		          I assume you are using some reasonably
		          current flavour of <b>Linux</b> not too unlike <b>Unbuntu</b>.
		          If you are not, it should affect very little once
		          you are actually using writing <b>Python</b>. You might
		          just occasionally have to think laterally when talking
		          directly to the <b>Operating System</b> (for example, when
		          downloading example files and putting them somewhere
		          they can be accessed by your code).
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using <b>Firefox</b>, set to display
		          text files in the browser. Irritatingly there
		          seems to be no browser that behaves itself as it should <b>100%</b>!
		          Even <b>Firefox</b> required some bizarre manipulations (of my
		          data/code files) to play nicely!
		          I expect you could cope with any browser
		          that is convenient to you, I simply suggest that
		          <b>Firefox</b> might give you the easiest ride.
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using
		          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython"
		           target="_blank"><b>CPython</b></a>, which is the default
		          implementation of <b>Python</b>, written in <b>C</b>.
		          I imagine you are, no need to check as all the practical
		          elements of this tutorial should work fine what
		          ever you are using. Only some of the background
		          discussion will be specific to <b>CPython</b>
		          (particularly with regard to <b>extensibility</b> and the like)
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          I assume you are using <b>Python 3.6</b> or better.
		          If so, everything will work fine. If you are are using
		          an earlier version of <b>Python 3</b>, that should be good enough.
		          Just a few things might not be quite as described
		          (particularly the ordering of <b>Dictionaries</b>). If you
		          are using <b>Python 2</b>, you will find significant
		          differences to the extent I would advise you to
		          update you <b>Python</b> installation.
          </p>
		          
          <p>
		          <b>Python 3</b> was introduced in <b>2008</b>
		          and so <b>Python 2</b>
		          has been "obsolete" for <b>10 years</b> now.
		          As <b>Python 3</b>
		          is significantly different to <b>Python 2</b>, there has
		          been an understandable reluctance for people
		          maintaining substantial volumes of <b>Python 2</b> code to
		          move to <b>Python 3</b>. However, teaching a
		          new generation of programmers to use a Language
		          that has not been current for a <b>decade</b> and from
		          which support will soon be withdrawn
		          (<b>First day of 2020</b>)
		          does not seem to be too sensible.
		          Accordingly. this tutorial presents <b>Python 3</b>
		          (unlike a number of other training programs
		          you might find on the web).

        <h2>Preparing to investigate Python Commands</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>In order to investigate the wonders of <b>Python</b>,
             it is essential to first to set up your computing
             environment in a suitable fashion.
          </p>

          <p>Essentially, this means readying the software that
             processes <b>Python</b> commands for action.
          </p>

          <p>This short section is comprised of a short
             description of the relevant software plus
             instruction on how to set it going in the
             fashion appropriate for the initial stages of
             the tutorial.
          </p>

              <hh4>The Python Interpreter.</hh4>
            </span>
          </summary>

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              The <b>Python Interpreter</b> is the program
              that reads your <b>Python code</b>, and
              instructs the computer to obey. If you are
              very lucky, the computer sometimes
              actually does what you intended!<br><br>

              You can use the <b>Python Interpreter</b> in two
              very different ways:<br>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Interactively</b> - great for running
                  scripts one line at a time, for testing
                  out ideas or new commands.<br><br>

                  Using the <b>Python Interpreter</b>
                  interactively is rather like using a calculator
                  in fact.<br><br>

                  If the <b>Python Interpreter</b> is started
                  interactively, it remains active having completed
                  a task(waiting for the
                  next interactive command) until explicitly
                  told to go away!
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-interactively</b> - in which the
                  <b>Python Interpreter</b> is started to run an
                  entire <b>Python script</b>. Once this
                  is achieved, the <b>Python Interpreter</b>
                  will <b><i>NOT</i></b> wait for
                  further instruction, it will simply close down.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              is the best plan. So:<br><br>

                <li>
                  Start up a <b>Terminal</b>

                <li>
                  Move into a suitable <b>Directory</b>.

                <li>

        <h2>Scalar Values</h2>

        <div>
          <p>A <b>Scalar Value</b> is a single item of data.
                </p>

          <p><b>Scalar Data Items</b> can be one of
             a variety of <b>types</b> including:<br>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>int</b> - Integers, that is
                "<b>whole numbers</b>".
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>float</b> - Floating point number,
                that is numbers
                with something after the decimal point.
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>bool</b> - Boolean values, that is
                <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.
              </li><br>

              <li>
                <b>str</b> - A sequence of <b>Characters</b>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>The two terms <b>type</b> and <b>class</b> are,
             these days, effectively synonyms. I will use
             them interchangeably in this tutorial.
             Historically, there was a significant difference.
             If you are interested, you could look

             but I would not advise doing so at this point.

                  A <b>string</b> is a series (or "ordered set")
                  of <b>characters</b>.<br><br>

                  The number of <b>characters</b> in a
                  <b>string</b> can vary between
                  <b>none</b> and <b>lots</b>.<br><br>

                  <b>characters</b> comprising a
                  <b>string</b> must be enclosed in
                  quotes. Either <b>single</b>
                  or <b>double quotes</b> will work.<br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> ''<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> ""<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> 'a'<br>
                    'a'<br>
                    >>> "a"<br>
                    'a'<br>
                    >>> 'abc'<br>
                    'abc'<br>
                    >>> "abc"<br>
                    'abc'<br>
                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Whether to use <b>single</b> or
                  <b>double quotes</b> is a matter
                  of personal preference. As you
                  see, <b>Python</b> appears to
                  prefer <b>single quotes</b> as it
                  converts all <b>double quotes</b>
                  consistently.<br><br>

                  A common preference is to use
                  <b>single quotes</b> for
                  <b>single characters</b>, or short
                  strings devoid of a significant
                  "<b>Natural Language</b>" message,
                  but to use <b>double quotes</b> for
                  anything that reads coherently as
                  would, for example, a quote from a
                  book.<br><br>

                  The simplest way to do this is to use

                  <hh5m>Escape Characters</hh5m><br><br>

                  Some characters are difficult to
                  include in a <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                  For example, a character to indicate that
                  a <b>String</b> should be split into more than
                  one line.<br><br>

                  It is no good hitting the
                  <b>Enter Key</b>, that will start a new
                  line in
                  your code, but not in the <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                  The answer is to use <b>Escape characters</b>
                  (also called <b>Escape Sequences</b> or <b>Escape
                  Codes</b>). Click for a
                  <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/list-of-python-escape-sequence-characters-with-examples"
                   target="_blank"> Full List of the Escape
                  Characters available in Python</a>.<br><br>

                  An <b>Escape Sequence</b> always starts with a
                  <b>backslash</b> ('<b>\</b>'), which
                  indicates that the following
                  <b>Characters(s)</b> are to be assigned a
                  special meaning within the <b>String</b>.
                  For example,
                  the <b>Character</b> needed to insert a
                  <b>newline</b> into
                  a <b>String</b> is <b>Line Feed</b>.
                  The <b>Escape code</b>
                  for <b>Line Feed</b> is <b>\n</b>. So,
                  a <b>Multiple Line
                  String</b> maybe assembled as follows:<br><br>

                  <span class="command13">
                    >>> Multi_String = "A was once an
                    ant,\nTiny,\nBusy,\nSpeedy,\nShiny\n
                    In the groundy\n
                    Little ant!"<br>
                    >>> print (Multi_String)<br>
                    A was once an ant,<br>
                    Tiny,<br>
                    Busy,<br>
                    Speedy,<br>
                    Shiny<br>
                    In the groundy<br>
                    Little ant!<br>
                    >>>

                  <p class="hint">
                    <b>Note:</b> Unfortunately the <b>Interactive
                    Interpreter</b> does not deal properly with
                    <b>Escape Codes</b> directly.<br><br>

                    The easiest way to deal with this problem is to
                    introduce the use of the <b>Builtin function
                    print()</b>
                    to display <b>Strings</b> a little ahead
                    of schedule.
                    <b>print()</b> is more powerful than is
                    implied here, as you will see soon.

                  A rather energetic way to announce methods
                  to isolate <b>Subsets</b> of
                  <b>Strings</b> (<b>substrings</b>
                  if you wish).<br><br>

                  To isolate a single <b>Character</b> of a
                  <b>String</b>, use square brackets enclosing
                  the position of the character required.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> A_Long_String = "The basis of optimism
                    is sheer terror"<br>
                    >>> A_Long_String[1]<br>
                    'h'<br>
                    >>> A_Long_String[0]<br>
                    'T'<br>
                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Good plan, but should not
                  <b>A_Long_String[1]</b>
                  have returned the first letter of this gloomy
                  reflection of
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde"
                   target="_blank">Oscar Wilde</a>?<br><br>

                  In fact, the second letter has been returned
                  due to the tendency for counting to begin
                  at <b>0</b> in computing.<br><br>

                  Indeed! <b>A_Long_String[0]</b> does the
                  trick.<br><br>

                  To "<b>Slice</b>" out a section from a
                  <b>String</b>, you need to use <b>2</b>
                  numbers separated by a <b>colon</b>
                  ('<b>:</b>') in the square brackets.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar = "Be yourself;
                    everyone else is already taken"<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:0]<br>
                    ''<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:1]<br>
                    'B'<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:2]<br>
                    'Be'<br>
                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Notice that the <b>Slice</b> is defined from
                  the first position to be included in the
                  <b>Slice</b> to the position following the
                  last to be included.<br><br>

                  <span class="command">
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar = "Be yourself;
                    everyone else is already taken"<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[0:11]<br>
                    'Be yourself'<br>
                    >>> Another_one_from_Oscar[:11]<br>

                    >>>
                  </span><br><br>

                  Notice that if the first number is omitted,

                            Easy! Splice from the 5th character to
                            the 40th character.<br><br>

                            Exactly the same output? This time
                            though, the third argument asks
                            explicitly that every character
                            (stepping along the string <b>1</b>
                            character at a time) be selected for
                            inclusion in the <b>Splice</b>.<br><br>

                            As no explicit "step" argument was
                            offered in the previous example,
                            <b>1</b> was assumed and so the result
                            was identical.<br><br>

                            requested and the wise sentiments of
                            <b>Oscar</b> become more than a

                            Negative <b>Arguments</b> refer to
                            positions counting from the end of
                            the <b>String</b>.<br><br>

                            We cannot start from <b>0</b> this
                            time as that is already reserved for
                            the first position, so
                            <b>Oscar_Again[-1]</b> is the very
                            last <b>Character</b> of the quote,
                            which is an '<b>h</b>'.<br><br>

                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2]</b> has to be
                            the next <b>Character</b> in, which
                            is a '<b>c</b>'.<br><br>

                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2:-1]</b> is also
                            just '<b>c</b>'. Remember the second
                            <b>Argument</b> refers to the
                            position beyond the last one included
                            in the slice.<br><br>

                            So, maybe <b>Oscar_Again[-2:0]</b>
                            will take me to the end of the
                            <b>String</b>? But no!!! Position
                            <b>0</b> is the first <b>Character</b>,
                            so <b>Oscar_Again[-2:0]</b> is
                            impossible and therefore returns
                            the <b>Empty String</b>.<br><br>

                            To slice to the end, using negative
                            indices, requires that the end
                            <b>Argument</b> be omitted, as in
                            <b>Oscar_Again[-2:]</b>. The
                            <b>Default Value</b> is the end of
                            the <b>String</b>, so all is well.
                            Something a little uncomfortable
                            about this? But ... it works.<br><br>

                            The point of these two examples is
                            to make explicit how one has to
                            provide the start at end points of
                            the splice form left to right, even
                            when using negative indices.<br><br>

                            I am not quite sure why, but this
                           causes me some mental anguish. I get

                  Using the Python feature '<b>in</b>',
                  it is possible to test for the presence
                  of one <b>String</b> within another.
                  For example, examining the inspirational
                  boast of the White Queen to a
                  doubting Alice:<br><br>

                  <span class="command15">
                    >>> Alice = "Why, sometimes I've believed
                    as many as six impossible things before
                    breakfast"<br>
                    >>> "impossible" in Alice<br>
                    True<br>
                    >>> "impossible" not in Alice<br>

                  </span><br><br>

                  Clearly, '<b>not in</b>' can be used to test for
                  the absence of a <b>substring</b>.<br><br>

                  A <b>Conditional Expression</b> is a
                  <b>Statement</b> that is either
                  <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>. That is,
                  a <b>Statement</b> whose <b>value</b>
                  is of type <b>bool</b>.<br><br>

                  For example, in <b>Python</b>,
                  "<b>6 == 6</b>" reads "<b>6 is equal
                  to 6</b>", which is generally considered
                  to be <b>True</b>, whereas, "<b>6 != 6</b>",
                  which reads "<b>6 is not equal to 6</b>"
                  is accepted by most as mendacious!<br><br>

                  The magnitude of a <b>character</b>
                  (and so a <b>character string</b>) is
                  determined by the numeric value used to
                  represent it in the computer
                  (typically its <b>ASCII code</b>,
                  more later).<br><br>

                  For purely <b>alphabetic strings</b>,
                  the order is simply <b>standard

                  As previously mentioned, <b>Scalar Values</b>
                  of type <b>bool</b> can have just one
                  of two possible values,
                  <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.<br><br>

                  <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> are represented
                  in the computer by <b>Integers</b>
                  (<b>Scalar Values</b> of the type
                  <b>int</b>). Some arrangement of this
                  sort is imperative as
                  <b><i>everything</i></b> is a number
                  inside a computer,
                  if you look hard enough.<br><br>

                  So, in a very practical sense,
                  <b>bools</b>
                  are a <b>sub-class</b> (<b>sub-type</b>) of
                  the <b>Python class</b>
                  (<b>type</b>) <b>int</b>.<br><br>

                  <b><i>Quite arbitrarily</i></b>, as
                  <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> have no
                  logical association with any numeric
                  value, <b>True</b> is represented as the
                  <b>Integer 1</b> and <b>False</b> as the
                  <b>Integer 0</b>.<br><br>

                  You <b><i>could</i></b> replace <b>True</b>
                  and <b>False</b> in your code by <b>1</b>
                  and <b>0</b>, but why would you ever wish
                  to???? It would merely obscure and would
                  represent extremely poor style.<br><br>

                  You <b><i>could</i></b> do arithmetic
                  with <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> and they
                  would act as if they were the <b>Integers
                  1</b> and <b>0</b> respectively. But why
                  on earth would you want to??? Not only

                  I have used more <b>parentheses</b> than

                  when there are lots of brackets everywhere.

                        <b>Python</b> sets out to be "lean
                        and mean". It does not try to offer
                        <b>builtin</b> functionality for
                        everything,
                        preferring instead the "efficiencies" of
                        simplicity. The user is expected to fill
                        any gaps.<br><br>

                        Generally a defensible policy, but just
                        occasionally one does wonder if
                        <b>Python</b>'s designers might not have
                        taken a tiny step to far?<br><br>

                        In this case, no <b>Exclusive OR
                        Operator</b> (normally offered as
                        "<b>xor</b>")? I wonder why?<br><br>

                        Just in case, were <b>xor</b> included,
                        the interpretation would be:<br><br>

                          <i>&lt;Condition1&gt;</i> <b>xor</b>

                        Think about it ... it works, Honest!
                        It is a bit clumsy, but it reads
                        nicely (if you take it slowly), which
                        I think is very important.<br><br>

                  How might the functionality of the missing

                      Probably the best way to compensate
                      for the omission of <b>xor</b> is
                      to extend
                      <b>Python</b> by bolting
                      on extra functionalities available
                      from various sources. We will cover
                      how to do that very soon.<br><br>

                      Or ... you could write your own
                      extension? We will see how to do that
                      to ... later.<br><br>

                      In the meantime, the solution that
                      I like the best uses only what we
                      have discussed thus far. There are
                      less clumsy (but more enigmatic)
                      solutions that require tricks we
                      have not covered, but I would still

        <h2>Scalar Variables</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>A <b>Scalar Variable</b> can be thought of as a named
             "<i>Container</i>" in which a <b>Scalar Value</b>
             might be stored.
          </p>

          <p><b>Scalar Variables</b> are typed according to
             the <b>Scalar Value</b> they are assigned.
             That is, a <b>Scalar Variable</b> takes on the same
             <b>type</b> (or <b>class</b>) as the <b>Scalar Value</b>
             it "contains".
          </p>

          <p>Loosely, with only <b>Scalar Values</b> we
             could just do "<b>Arithmetic</b>", adding
             <b>Scalar Variables</b> enables "<b>Algebra</b>".
          </p>
          
          <p>The discussion that follows applies
             (unless explicitly stated
             otherwise) not just to <b>Scalar Variables</b>, but to
             <b>Variables</b> that "contain" the more complex
             entities that will
             be covered later in this tutorial.
          </p>

          <p>Again, these entities will be
             investigated using the <b>Python
             Interpreter</b> interactively.

              There is no requirement to explicitly
              <b>declare</b> (<b>create</b>)
              <b>Variables</b> in <b>Python</b>.
              A <b>Variable</b> is created the moment
              it is first assigned a <b>Value</b>. Until it
              is <b>assigned</b> a <b>Value</b>,
              a <b>Variable</b> does not exist.<br><br>

              <span class="command">

                >>>
              </span><br><br>

              There is no requirement to explicitly assign a
              <b>type</b> to a <b>Variable</b>. It will assume
              the <b>type</b> of the <b>Value</b> it is
              assigned.<br><br>

              The <b>type</b> of a <b>Variable</b> is not fixed.
              It will change to match the <b>type</b> of each
              <b>Value</b> it is assigned<br><br>

              <span class="command">
                >>> b = 2<br>
                >>> b<br>
                2<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = 2.7<br>
                >>> b<br>
                2.7<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'float'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = True<br>
                >>> b<br>
                True<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'bool'&gt;<br>
                >>> b = "I am a very nice string"<br>
                >>> b<br>
                'I am a very nice string'<br>
                >>> type(b)<br>
                &lt;class 'str'&gt;<br>
                >>>
              </span><br>

              <p class="hint"><b>Note</b>: <b>type()</b> is
                 a <b>Python Builtin Function</b>. That is,
                 a facility that <b>Python</b> considers to be
                 of great sufficient "importance" to be offered,
                 "ready coded", as part of the language.<br><br>

                We will discuss <b>Builtin Functions</b>, and
                <b>User Defined Functions</b>, later and in
                some depth.<br><br>

                I introduce <b>type()</b>, ahead of time as it
                serves a purpose useful here and now.<br><br>

                <b>type()</b> takes a <b>Variable</b> as an
                <b>Argument</b>, which is placed between the
                <b>brackets ()</b>, and it returns the <b>type</b>
                (or <b>class</b>) of that <b>Variable</b>.

                        <p>A trivial question to start?
                        </p>

                        <p>A single '<b>=</b>', in <b>Python</b>,
                           is used for <b>Assignment
                           Statements</b>. So:<br><br>

                          <span class="command">
                            a=6
                          </span><br><br>

                           reads as "<i><b>Assign</b> the
                           <b>Integer Value</b> '<b>6</b>'
                           to the <b>Variable</b> called
                           '<b>a</b>'</i>".
                        </p>

                        <p>But <b>Python</b> also needs to be
                           able to say "<i>is equal to</i>"
                           when constructing <b>Conditional
                           Expressions</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Trying to use a
                           single '<b>=</b>' again would be
                           ambiguous and so unacceptable.
                        </p>

                        <p>The <b>Python</b> solution is to use
                           a double '<b>=</b>' ('<b>==</b>'), as
                           you have already seen when looking
                           at <b>bool type Scalar Values</b>).
                        </p>

                        <p>So:<br><br>

                          </span><br><br>

                           reads "<i>'<b>a</b>'
                           is equal to '<b>6</b>'</i>", which is
                           either <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>,
                           that is, a <b>bool Data type</b>.
                        </p>

                        <span class="command">
                          >>> a = 6<br>

              <b>Variables</b> in <b>Python</b> follow

              Only <b>Alphanumeric Characters</b> and
              <b>Underscore</b> (<b>A-Z</b>,
              <b>a-z</b>, <b>0-9</b>, and <b>_</b> )
              may be used.
              <b>Variable Names</b> cannot begin with

              Beginning a <b>Variable Name</b>
              with a <b>Numeric</b> seems quite harmless?
              But I suppose it is an easy strategy to
              discourage (accidental or otherwise)
              use of really silly <b>ALL</b> numeric
              <b>Names</b>.<br><br>

                        The easiest way to find out

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              <b>Python Reserves</b> certain words
              for particular purposes. Such words are,
              with breath draining originality, called
              <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list"
               target="_blank"><b>Reserved Words</b></a>.<br><br>

              Clearly, <b>Reserved Words</b> can only serve
              their one anointed purpose and so are not
              available for use as <b>Variable Names</b>.<br><br>

              There are lots of <b>Python Reserved Words</b>.
              However, thus far, we have only met <b>four</b>.
              They are the <b>Boolean Operators</b>
              '<b>and</b>' '<b>or</b>' '<b>not</b>', plus
              '<b>in</b>' (used to test the
              presence of
              <b>Strings</b> within <b>Strings</b>).<br><br>

              Any attempt to use these (or any other
              <b>Reserved Word</b>) as a <b>Variable
              Name</b> would result in stern rebuke from
              the <b>Python Interpreter</b>.<br><br>

              <span class="command">

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and = 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> or = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> not = 3<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not = 3<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^
                <br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> in = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in = 2<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> xor = 4<br>
                >>> xor<br>
                4<br>
                >>>
              </span><br><br>

              Note that, <b>xor</b> is not a <b>Reserved Word</b>,
              though some might wonder why not? So, <b>xor</b>
              works as a <b>Variable Name</b> just fine.<br><br>

                    The "Eagle Eyed" amongst you might have
                    noticed that the
                    '<b>^</b>' attempting to pinpoint the
                    position of the
                    <b>Error</b> points to the <b>Boolean

                    case of '<b>and</b>' & '<b>or</b>',
                    but it points at the
                    '<b>=</b>' sign for the
                    <b>Error</b> associated with
                    '<b>not</b>'? Can you explain why?<br>

                    <details class="answer">

                      <div class="answer">

                        The reason for the difference is
                        that '<b>not</b>'
                        can be a <b>Unary Operator</b>.
                        This is not so
                        for either '<b>and</b>' or
                        '<b>or</b>'.<br><br>

                        That is to say, "<b>not True</b>"
                        is semantically
                        meaningful. It means
                        "<b>False</b>".<br><br>

                          >>>
                        </span><br><br>

                        Similarly, "<b>not False</b>" is
                        semantically
                        meaningful. It means "<b>True</b>".<br><br>

                        <span class="command">
                          >>> not False<br>
                          True<br>
                          >>>
                        </span><br><br>

                        But "<b>or True</b>", "<b>and True</b>"?
                        These are both nonsense.<br><br>

                        <span class="command">

                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or True<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br>

                          >>> and True<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;",
                          line 1<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and True<br>

                        So, by the time the <b>Interpreter</b>
                        (working from <b>left</b> to <b>right</b>)
                        gets to the end
                        of the <b>Boolean</b> '<b>and</b>'

                        However, if the first word is
                        '<b>not</b>', it just
                        could be a legal use of a
                        <b>Reserved Word</b>! Maybe
                        an attempt to display "<b>not True</b>",
                        "<b>not False</b>", or
                        "<b>not x</b>", where '<b>x</b>'
                        is any numeric value (or even a
                        string!?).<br><br>

                        Remember, as far as the computer is
                        concerned, <b>False</b> is the
                        same as <b>0</b> and any other
                        numeric value is seen as
                        <b>True</b>.<br><br>

                        A <b>String Value</b> for '<b>x</b>'
                        works because
                        <b>Python</b> arbitrarily dictates
                        that <b>ANY</b> string, when used
                        as a <b>Conditional Expression</b>,
                        will be interpreted as
                        <b>True</b>, except the empty
                        string (<b>""</b>) which will be considered
                        <b>False</b>.<br><br>

                    It has been established that

                    Is <b>type</b> therefore a

                    cannot be used as a <b>Variable Name</b>?

                       Using <b>type</b> as a <b>Variable Name</b>
                       works fine.<br><br>

                       One might dismissively say <i>"Of course,

                       Word</b>!"</i>. However, <b>type</b>
                       does "feel" like a
                       word that has been assign a fixed
                       purpose, in some
                       sense?<br><br>

                       The vital point is, <b>type()</b>
                       is the Function,
                       not <b>type</b>.<br><br>

                       <b>type()</b> is only recognised

                       word <b>type</b> is
                       <b><i>NOT</i></b> special at all,

                      So, the simple answers to the questions
                      posed are:<br><br>

                      <b>True</b>, <b>False</b> and
                      <b>None</b> are all <b>Reserved Words</b>.
                      So I lied, we have met <b>7
                      Reserved Words</b> so far!<br><br>

                      <b>True</b>, <b>False</b> and
                      <b>None</b> are all unavailable for use
                      as <b>Variable Names</b>.<br><br>

                      But, look at the <b>Error Message</b>
                      this time. It specifies the reason
                      for disallowing <b>True</b>,
                      <b>False</b>, <b>None</b> is
                      that they
                      are <b>Keywords</b>?

                      So, what is the difference between a
                      <b>Keyword</b> and a
                      <b>Reserved Word</b>?<br>

                      <p class="hint">In <b>Python</b>,
                         <i>"There is no
                         difference that matters a jot!"
                         </i>, so its fine to skip the
                         next bit if you wish.

                      Essentially, my summary, based on my

                       target="_blank"> best hit</a> from
                       many google searches, is as follows:<br><br>

                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Keywords</b> have a special
                          meaning in a language, and are
                          part of the <b>Syntax</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Reserved words</b> are words
                          that cannot be used as
                          <b>Variable Names</b> (and similar),
                          because they are <b>Reserved</b>
                          by the <b>Language</b>.
                        </li>
                      </ul><br>

                      OK, I simplify this to:<br><br>
                      <i>"<b>Keywords</b> are words it would
                      be silly to use as <b>Variable Names</b>
                      as they already have already been assigned
                      constant <b>Values</b>.<br><br>
                      
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> are words that the
                      <b>Language</b> has forbidden to be used
                      as <b>Variable Names</b>, for any
                      of a number of reasons."</i><br><br>

                      In <b>Python</b>, <b>Reserved words</b>
                      and <b>Keywords</b> <b>Coincide</b>
                      (that is, all <b>Keywords</b> are
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> and vice versa),
                      which surely has to be sensible?<br><br>
                      
                      The only mystery remaining is why
                      <b>Python</b> makes life mysterious
                      by varying its <b>Error Messages</b>
                      for different types of
                      <b>Keywords</b>? No mystery really,
                      the <b>Interpreter</b> just notices
                      that <b>and</b> and <b>or</b> are
                      both <b>Binary Operators</b> and so
                      cannot be the first word of a
                      command, <b><i>before</i></b> it
                      notices they are also <b>Reserved Words</b>.
                      Strictly speaking, there should
                      be two <b>Error Messages</b>,
                      but the <b>Interpreter</b> is
                      content to rush on once the
                      first terminal failure is detected.<br><br>

                      A <b>Language</b> does
                      not <b><i>have</i></b> to <b>Reserve</b> any
                      <b>Keywords</b>! Why not allow a user
                      to assign any <b>Value</b> he/she wishes
                      to <b>True</b> (and similar) ... and
                      then enjoy the chaos? Older languages
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word"
                       target="_blank">
                      (<b>FORTRAN</b>, <b>PL/1</b>, <b>Algol</b>)
                      have lots of <b>Keywords</b> but no
                      <b>Reserved Words</b></a>!!
                      We believed in "Living life on the edge"
                      in those days!<br><br>

                      It is even possible to have
                      <b>Reserved Words</b> that are not
                      <b>Keywords</b>. A word that is not
                      currently a <b>Keyword</b> might be
                      <b>Reserved</b> because it might be a

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              A single, hopefully obvious, point to be made
              here, about
              <b>Style</b>, rather than <b>Syntax</b>
              or <b>Semantics</b>.<br><br>

              An issue about which the <b>Interpreter</b>
              will not care a jot!
              <b><i>BUT</i></b>, is of great importance if
              you are to write code
              that can be easily understood and maintained
              by others ... or
              even yourself after just a few short months
              (hours! for those
              of you who have achieved a similar level of
              maturity to myself!).<br><br>

              It is vital to construct your code as
              coherently as possible.
              Strategies include:<br>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Copious Comments</b>. Something to
                  which we will return
                  when we write short programs rather
                  than examine single
                  statements with the <b>Interactive
                  Interpreter</b>.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                  Maintaining a prominent <b>Outline</b>
                  of what your code is
                  trying to achieve (<b>pseudo-code</b>?).
                  Again, something to
                  expand upon later.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                  A meaningful choice of <b>Variable Names</b>.
                  It is too
                  tempting to use anonymous single letter
                  <b>Variable Names</b>
                  that convey nothing of their purpose for
                  existence.<br><br>

                  Really just an element of commenting your
                  code adequately,
                  as is trying to avoid enigmatic presentation
                  of data.<br><br>

                  I attempt to demonstrate. Contrast these two
                  code segments
                  of identical raw purpose.<br><br>

            The <b>Scalars</b> considered thus far enable basic
            <b>Arithmetic</b>, <b>Algebraic</b> and simple
            String manipulatory operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Python</b>
            builds on this provision with some
            "<i>ready coded</i>" <b>Functions</b> that are
            integral to the language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Such features are called <b>Builtin Functions</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            A more comprehensive discussion of <b>Functions</b>
            (and similar) will be offered when
            <b>User Defined Functions</b> are considered a
            little later. For now, a <b>Function</b> is
            a code block that (<b>Optionally</b>) accepts
            <b>Arguments</b> and returns a <b>Value</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#print"
             target="_blank"><b>type()</b></a> and
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#print"
             target="_blank"><b>print()</b></a>, which you have
            already superficially used,
            are examples of <b>Builtin Functions</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As used above, <b>type()</b> accepts
            a single <b>Argument</b> (a <b>Scalar Value</b>
            or <b>Variable</b>) and returns information
            revealing the <b>Class</b> of that <b>Scalar</b>.
          </p>

          <span class="command">
            >>> type (4.657)<br>
            &lt;class 'float'&gt;<br>
            >>> type(32)<br>
            &lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
            >>> type("It is Sunday")<br>
            &lt;class 'str'&gt;<br>
            >>>
          </span><br>

          <p>
            So far, we have used <b>print</b> just to
            display simple <b>Strings</b> (as <b>Scalar
            Values</b> or <b>Variables</b>).
          </p>

          <span class="command">
            >>> print("Saturday night\nJust got paid")<br>
            Saturday night<br>
            Just got paid<br>
            >>> Diminutive_Dick="Fool about my money\nDon't
            have to save"<br>
            >>> print (Diminutive_Dick)<br>
            Fool about my money<br>
            Don't have to save<br>
            >>>
          </span><br>

          <p>
            A complete list of all
            <b>Python Builtin Functions</b>, all with very
            comprehensive descriptions will be useful for
            reference, and can be found

          <p>
            It would not be useful to try and describe them
            all here!
            Instead, I suggest we introduce a few of the more
            vital examples and add other as the need arises (via

                        Picky!!! I would have expected this one
                        to work, but <b>int()</b> will not
                        convert the <b>float String</b>. I
                        suspect because that would involve
                        <b>TWO</b> conversions, and
                        <b>int()</b> has a strong Union
                        position to maintain.<br><br>

                        Of course, you could do the first
                        conversion explicitly and then all
                        would be fine?<br><br>

                        <span class="command">
                          >>> int(float("98.9"))<br>

                          >>>
                        </span><br>

                        <p class="hint"> Just in case I have
                          not already mentioned it, <b>int</b>
                          to <b>float</b> conversions
                          <b><i>ALWAYS</i></b> round
                          <b><i>DOWN</i></b>.
                          Rather unsubtle, but that is
                          universally the <b>Rule</b>.<br><br>

                          So <b>98.9</b> becomes <b>98</b>
                          and not <b>99</b>.<br>

                        Makes perfect sense to me! But, I

                        of the way numbers are represented in
                        the computer.<br><br>

                        The computer uses a <b>Binary</b>
                        representation, not <b>Decimal</b>.
                        It is not possible to represent
                        <b>2.675</b> exactly as a binary number.<br><br>

                        If you do the conversion (using a handy

                        from the web if you are in a hurry), you
                        will discover that <b>5.675 Decimal</b> is:<br><br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>10.1011(0011)*</b><br><br>

                        which approaches (from below),
                        but never reaches
                        <b>2.675</b> as it is allowed to get
                        longer and longer.<br><br>

                        So, <b>abs()</b> is rounding a number that is
                        nearly, but not quite <b>2.675</b>,
                        honestly ... but wrongly (if you

                  <b>input()</b> takes one <b>Argument</b>,
                  which is usually a simple <b>String</b>.
                  This is displayed (typically) on the
                  <b>Computer Screen</b> as a <b>Prompt</b>
                  to the user to enter a response.<br><br>

                  <b>input()</b> returns, as a
                  <b>String</b>, whatever the user types
                  in response to the <b>Prompt</b>.<br><br>

                   target="_blank"><b>print()</b></a>
                  is primarily intended to display
                  information to the <b>Display Screen</b>.<br><br>

                  We have already used it to output single
                  <b>Strings</b>. It can also handle mixed
                  sets of other data types.

                  <b>print()</b> works by
                  converting all <b>Numeric Arguments</b>
                  to <b>Strings</b>, Boolean Arguments
                  are evaluated as <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.

                  By default, <b>Arguments</b> are displayed as a
                  <b>Space</b> separated list.<br><br>

                        <b>print()</b> is more versatile than
                        has been shown thus far.<br><br>

                        For example, the <b>Output List</b>
                        is a <b>Space</b> separated list
                        by default, but the separator can be
                        varied using the <b>sep Argument</b>
                        which follows the list of
                        <b>Arguments</b> to be displayed.<br><br>

                        To use a <b>Comma Separator</b>,
                        for example, would require
                        "<b>sep=','</b>" to be appended to the
                        list of </i>"things to be
                        displayed"</i>.<br><br>

                        Try a novel separator or three,

                        By default, <b>print()</b> ends its
                        output with a <b>newline</b>
                        ('<b>\n</b>'). In fact,
                        <b>print()</b>, with no
                        <b>Arguments</b>, generates an empty
                        line. This can sometimes be useful
                        (Try it).<br><br>

                        To choose a different way to end a line
                        of output, use the <b>end
                        Argument</b>, which works in a very
                        similar fashion to the
                        <b>sep Argument</b>.<br><br>

                        <b>end</b> must come after all the
                        </i>"things to be displayed"</i> and is
                        of the form "<b>end='\n\n\n'</b>"
                        (should one want <b>three newlines</b>
                        in place of the default
                        <b>one</b>).<br><br>

                            To be honest, I just thought you
                            would like to read the whole
                            Limerick. One of
                            <a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/edward-lear/poems/"

                             target="_blank">Edward Lear</a>.
                            Very good for last thing at night
                            with the jolly old cocoa! His best is
                            <a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-owl-and-the-pussy-cat/"
                             target="_blank">"The Owl and the
                            Pussy Cat"</a>, do try it sometime,
                            especially if it evaded your
                            childhood indulgences.<br><br>

                            More mundanely, Note that:<br><br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                This very long command was
                                typed over several lines.<br><br>

                                The <b>Interpreter</b> knows
                                you cannot have finished the
                                <b>print()</b> command until
                                the terminating '<b>)</b>' is
                                reached, so it just keeps
                                prompting for more (with
                                '<b>...</b>') until it arrives
                                (Try it).

                                <p class="hint">
                                  The "<b>breaks</b>" cannot be placed
                                  just anywhere.<br><br>

                                  You must choose a place that is
                                  not going to confuse the
                                  <b>Interpreter</b> too much.<br><br>

                                  In the example above, I chose the
                                  end of each line of the Limerick,
                                  which worked fine!
                                </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                In this command both the
                                <b>sep</b> and the
                                <b>end Arguments</b> are used.
                              </li>
                            </ul><br>
                          </div>
                        </details>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </div><br>

                  As has been shown, <b>print()</b>
                  can be used to print <b>Numbers</b>,
                  but only with very little control
                  over the way those numbers are
                  formatted. That is to say:<br><br>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>float</b> -  how many
                      digits before and after the
                      decimal point?</li>

                    <li>
                      <b>int</b> - the longest value
                      to be tidily catered for?</li>
                  </ul><br>

                  There are a number of ways to
                  tackle this. Here consider the very
                  basics of the approach often referred
                  to as
                  <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_formatted_output.php"
                   target="_blank">The Old Way</a>
                  as it sets out to replicate the
                  functionality of the (not really
                  <b><i>THAT</b></i>) old
                  <b>printf</b> command in <b>C</b>.<br><br>

                  It has the advantage of being simple!
                  Well, given a bit of
                  thought anyway.<br><br>

                  An example, showing
                  the <b>Basic Format</b> is:</b></b><br><br>

                            It simply is not possible

                            The reason is that computers,

        <div>
          <p>
            A <b>method</b> is a <b>Function</b> that is
            specific to a particular <b>Python Data Class</b>
            (or <b>type</b>).
          </p>

          <p>
            Of the <b>Data Classes</b> discussed so far, only
            <b>Strings</b> really have and interesting range
            of <b>methods</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Accordingly, here it is the plan to start by
            looking at a few
            examples of <b>String methods</b>, to get the
            general idea, and the to discuss further
            <b>methods</b> as more the complex <b>Data
            Classes</b> are introduced.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you did wish to generate a list of all the
            available <b>methods</b> for a given <b>Class</b>,
            it is very easy. Just use the <b>Builtin Function</b>
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#help"
             target="_blank"><b>help()</b></a>.
            For example, to list all the
            <b>String methods</b>, type:
          </p>

          <span class="command">
            help(str)
          </span><br>

            Try it.

            </p>
            
            <p>
              Summarising further, for the purpose of this tutorial,
              I think it is OK to ignore anything with <b>Underscores</b>
              at either end of its <b>Name</b>.
              Particularly those with <b>Double Underscores</b>
              at both ends
              (<i>"essentially reserved for <b>Python</b> itself"</i>)
              and to resist using leading and/or trailing
              <b>Underscores</b> for <b>Variable Names</b> you create.
            </p>
           
          </div>

          <p>
            <b>Input</b> and <b>Output</b> from files stored
            on external storage devices (almost inevitably some
            sort of <b>Disk</b> these days) relies on a
            Builtin File to create a "<b>File Handle</b>" (or a <b>File
            Object</b> if you prefer).
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the <b>File</b> reference is created, accessing
            the file is
            exclusively (as far as this tutorial is concerned)
            accomplished using <b>methods</b> associated
            with <b>File Objects</b>. This being so provides
            a good excuse to
            cover <b>File I/O</b> here,
            while discussing the most important <b>File Object
            methods</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Displaying the complete list of <b>methods</b> available
            for a <b>File Object</b> with <b>help()</b> is not
            straight forward. <b>file</b> is not a simple single
            <b>class</b>. However, <b>help()</b>
            will work successfully on an <b><i>instance</i></b>
            of a <b>File Handle</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            So you could create a <b>File Handle</b> with the
            <b>Builtin Function open</b> and the give
            that <b>File Handle</b>
            to <b>help()</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The trouble with that plan, is you
            probably have no <b>file</b> handy to <b>open</b>!
          </p>

          <p>
            No problem! We cannot be defeated! So open a <b>file</b>
            specifying that you wish to <b><i>WRITE</i></b> to it (so it
            does not need to already exist). Then use <b>help()</b>
            on that, hopefully new and empty, <b>file</b>. Clever eh!?
          </p>

          <span class="command">
            >>> Empty_File=open("TEST", 'w')<br>
            >>> help(Empty_File)
          </span>

          <p>
            It is the <b>'w'</b> bit of the
            <b>open</b> command that requests a file for <b>writing</b>
            rather than just <b>reading</b> (the default)
          </p>

          <p>
            Try it ... or for the less adventurous, the entire list can be found

      <h2><u>Basic SYNTAX for using a method.</u></h2>

      <p>
      There are <b>four</b> ways of request
      the execution of a <b>method</b>.
      The first two are the more common.
      Informally the alternatives are:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>&lt;Variable Identifier&gt;.&lt;method&gt;(Arguments)</i>

          <i>&lt;Class Value&gt;.&lt;method&gt;(Arguments)</i>
        </li><br>

        An example requires exposure to at least one particular method.

      <p>
        OK, title is a method of the <b>Class str</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It capitalizes the first letter of each word of the
        <b>String</b> it processes. It needs no <b>Arguments</b> except
        the <b>String</b> to be capitalized.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>four</b> options, in order, would be:

      <p>
        Interesting that <b>title</b> makes the '<i>t</i>' of
        '<i>don't</i>' upper case? Perhaps a protest against the
        ghastly truncation? It certainly does not
        seem quite correct even so.

                The difference between <b>str.casefold()</b> and

                 target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

                Essentially, <b>str.lower()</b> only translates
                characters from the <b>Range A-Z</b> into their
                counterparts in the <b>Range a-z</b>.<br><br>
     
                <b>str.casefold()</b> attempts to cater for
                characters from other alphabets,
                which is very clever, but
                I think I will stick to <b>str.lower()</b> for the
                purposes of this tutorial.

	             <p>
	               There are far too many <b>str methods</b>
                  (<b>methods</b> in
                  general even) to try and include all in a
                  sensible
                  number of short exercises. I aim for a
                  representative few.
                </p>

	             <p>
                  If you wish to know more about any I omit,
                  I draw your
                  attention to the <b>Links</b> I have embedded
                  in the
                  <b>method Tables</b> (and the <b>List of
                  methods</b>
                  in the <b>Checkpoint</b> section).<br><br>
                </p>

	             <p>
                  These take you to the section of the
                  <b>Python manual</b> that
                  describes, fully, each <b>method</b>.<br>

                    Consider the <b>DNA</b> sequence:<br><br>

                    "<b>acgGTaCCCCCatcaaTTATgcccGT</b>"

                    Assuming the mixture of cases to be pure whimsy,
                    it is going to get in the way in any analysis
                    you might contemplate.!<br><br>

                    The way things are, your code would always have
                    cope with <b>two</b> representations of the
                    same actuality!
                    The first step must be to make the <b>Case</b> of
                    this <b>Sequence</b> consistent.<br><br>

                    Accordingly, write code to save the
                    following versions of the <b>Sequence</b>
                    into suitably named <b>Variables</b>.<br><br>

                    Use as many of the possible forms of syntax as

                  <li>
                  Once upon a time, the great <b>Spike</b>
                  (<b>Milligan</b> that is) composed a poem
                  that commenced thus:<br><br>

                  <i>"a poem by spike - about his granny<br><br>
                  through every nook and every cranny<br>
                  the wind blew in on poor old Granny<br>
                  around her knees, into each ear<br>
                  (and up nose as well, I fear)"</i><br><br>

                  You task is store the entire poem
                  in a single, suitably named, <b>Variable</b>
                  so that:<br><br>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The <b>Title</b>, (using <b>Title Case</b>,
                      of course)
                      is centred in <b>60 Characters</b>
                      with '<b>.</b>' as padding.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                       Each line of the poem (with the first
                       character <b>Upper Case</b>, of course)
                       is to be right adjusted in <b>40 Characters</b>
                       (<b>Fill Character</b> '<b>-</b>') and then left
                       adjusted in <b>60 Characters</b>
                       (<b>Fill Character</b> '<b>*</b>'))
                     </li>
                   </ul><br>

                     Note: You need to add <b>Line Feeds</b>
                     into your creation, or it will spill
                     out in a single line
                     (as it has just done for me!).

                   <p class="hint">
                     A number of the <b>methods</b> you will
                     need take both <b>Mandatory</b> and
                     <b>Optional Arguments</b> I have not

                     Look them up using the links to the
                     <b>Manual</b> provided. What you need to know
                     is clear at and the top of the page.<br><br>

                     From here on, I assume you do this
                     as a matter of course. To try and include
                     everything here would be very clumsy.<br><br>

                     Also, constant reference to <b>Manual
                     Pages</b> (and in desperation,
                     greater <b>Google</b>) is standard
                     coding practice).

                        <b>Note</b> the use of he <b>Backslash

                        long lines. The <b>Interpreter</b> will join

                        and interpret them as a singe line.<br><br>

                        I changed all the <b>Upper Case Letters</b> in
                        <a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/granny/"
                         target="_blank"><b>Spike's</b> original composition</a>,
                        vaguely wondering how many I could put back.<br><br>

                        I failed consistently on those not at the start of a line,
                        but I did have a small hope for "<b>(and</b>" being returned to
                        "<b>(And</b>" (Last Line). Given the way "<b>don't</b>" was
                        transformed to "<b>Don'T</b>" earlier. Ho hum, I have
                        survived greater disappointments.<br><br>

                        Note the way <b>methods</b> can be strung together.
                        For example
                        "....<b>capitalize().rjust(40,'-').ljust(60,'*')</b>".
                        If this is not the first time I have mentioned this,
                        it is called "<b>Reinforcement</b>" and is thus an
                        absolutely deliberate pedagogic strategy!

                    Not so many inspiring exercises for this
                    set of methods!<br><br>

                    I start by wondering what, precisely, is
                    the difference between
                    <b>str.isdecimal()</b>, <b>str.isdigit()</b> and
                    <b>str.isnumeric()</b>.<br><br>

                    The obvious way to find out is to consult
                    the appropriate <b>Manual
                    Pages</b> and then test out their
                    interpretation
                    with a few examples.<br><br>

                    Well, that is what I am about to do, have
                    a go and I will meet you in the answer.<br><br>

                        I was hoping for "simple here"! Not quite I fear.

                        After reading the <b>Manual Pages</b> and a
                        bit of <b>Googling</b>. I conclude that,
                        in the world of <b>Python</b>:<br><br>

                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <b>Decimals</b> are a subset of <b>Digits</b>.<br>
                            <b>Digits</b> are a subset of <b>Numerics</b>.<br>
                          </li><br>

                          <li>
                            <b>Decimals</b> are <b>Characters</b> in the
                            range <b>0</b> to <b>9</b>.
                            A mere <b>ten</b> possibilities.
                          </li><br>

                          <li>
                            <b>Digits</b> are <b>Decimals</b> or:
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                <b>Superscripts</b>.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <b>Subscripts</b>.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li><br>

                          <li>
                            <b>Numerics</b> are <b>Digits</b> or:
                             <ul>
                               <li>
                                <b>Roman Numerals</b>.<br>                            </li>
                              <li>
                                <b>Fractions</b>.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <b>Currency Numerators</b>.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                        The main complication with actually testing the
                        performance of the methods is that it is not
                        possible to just type in <b>Superscripts</b>,
                        <b>Subscripts</b>, <b>Roman Numerals</b>,
                        <b>Fractions</b> or <b>Currency Numerators</b>.
                        They simply do not exist on your
                        keyboard.<br>

                        <p class="hint">
                          Unfortunately, a <b>Roman Numerals</b>,
                          in this context, is not just a combination
                          of the Characters <b>I</b>, <b>V</b>,
                          <b>X</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>C</b>
                          and <b>M</b>".<br><br>

                          Each <b>Roman Numerals</b> has its own
                          <b>Unicode</b> representation. It is
                          that which is
                          <b>Numeric</b>, but not <b>Digital</b>
                          or <b>Decimal</b>
                          according to <b>Python</b>.<br><br>

                          I am not going to discuss <b>Unicode</b>
                          representation of <b>Numerals</b> here, but

                        <p class="hint">
                          I am not absolutely clear what

                          However, I have discovered an example
                          which will be sufficiency for
                          current needs.<br><br>

                          Enough!
                        </p>

                        <b>Unicode</b> representations for each type of
                        non <b>Keyboard Character</b> are required.
                        We have,
                        sufficient to test the methods.<br><br>

                        I built the <b>String</b> twice.
                        The first time with
                        <b>Spaces</b> to make it print clearly.
                        I thought
                        you would like to see the <b>Roman

                        The <b>Spaces</b> had to be removed
                        for the
                        test of course, as they would register
                        as non <b>Numeric</b> and spoil

                        Well, it worked OK. It admits to being a
                        <b>Numeric</b> but not a <b>Decimal</b>
                        or a <b>Digit</b>.<br><br>

                        I rest, wondering wearily what idiot
                        thought this might be a good
                        question to ask!!<br><br>

                        If I had to make a conclusion from all this
                        ramble (which I quite enjoyed, to tell the
                        truth), it would be that I think that
                        <b>isdecimal()</b> covers <b>99%</b>
                        of my needs.

                    Consider again the <b>Mixed Case DNA
                    Sequence</b> 
                    of a few exercises back:<br><br>
                
                    "<b>acgGTaCCCCCatcaaTTATgcccGT</b>"<br><br>
                
                    Previously we generated versions
                    with consistent <b>Case</b>.<br><br>
                
                    With the capacity to alter <b>Base Codes</b>
                    using
                    the method <b>str.replace()</b>, it is possible to also
                    <b>Complement</b> this <b>Sequence</b>
                    (<b>Reversing</b> will have
                    to wait a while).<br><br>
                
                    This is not as easy as it seems. You cannot,
                    for
                    example, simple replace all the '<b>A</b>'s
                    with
                    '<b>T</b>'s, '<b>G</b>'s, with '<b>C</b>'s,
                    '<b>T</b>s with '<b>A</b>'s and '<b>C</b>'s
                    with '<b>G</b>'s (think about it).<br><br>
                
                    I would advise a short planning session.
                    Jot down in <b>Natural Language</b> how you
                    intend
                    to achieve your goal before committing
                    yourself to <b>Python Code</b>.<br><br>
                
                    The result of this process is
                    called <b>Pseudo Code</b>, one of several ways to
                    plan out a solution to a problem (an
                    <b>Algorithm</b>)
                    before trying to express your requirements
                    in the stark terms the computer
                    requires.<br><br>
                
                    Trivial (I hope) in this case, but of
                    importance that grows with the complexity of
                    the problem you wish to solve.<br><br>
                
                    So, the task is, after a bit of careful
                    planning, to produce
                    an <b>Upper Case Complemented</b> version of
                    the <b>Sequence</b> above.<br><br>
                    
                    <p class="hint">
                      <b>replace()</b> requires <b>2 Mandatory
                      Arguments</b> and accepts a third <b>Optional Argument</b>.<br><br>
                      
                      You will need either to be good at guessing, or to look
                      these up before proceeding.

                        You want to include <b>Every Base</b> in

              <div>
                <b>str.find()</b>/<b>str.rfind()</b>
                and <b>str.index()</b>/<b>str.rindex()</b> differ only
                in that <b>str.index()</b>/<b>str.rindex()</b> will react more
                severely to a failure to succeed in
                their search for a <b>substring</b>. To the
                extent, indeed, that they will terminate
                the proceeding with an <b>Error Message</b>! This
                must be sensible on occasion, but does
                rather smack of petulance at first glance!
                I chose to favour the <b>str.find()</b>/<b>str.rfind()</b> approach
                for now.<br><br>

                The differences between the two options
                are discussed
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22190064/difference-between-find-and-index"
                 target="_blank">here</a>,
                should you be interested.<br><br>

                <p class="hint">
                  In the course of the referenced discussion,
                  a rather more vital difference between
                  the two options is mentioned.<br><br>

                  <b>str.find()</b>/<b>str.rfind()</b> can only be used for
                  <b>str Objects</b>!

                  <b>index()</b>/<b>rindex()</b> work with
                  <b>Strings</b> and more complex
                  <b>Data Objects</b> that will be discussed soon.
                  So, let us not dismiss <b>index()</b>/<b>rindex()</b>
                  too early!

                        make it more readable. <b>Comments</b> are good!! But not
                        really practical
                        when using <b>Python Interpreter interactively</b>.

                In this tutorial, I offer a couple of examples and a
                few simple exercises. <br><br>

                  <hh6m> str.format() for Positional Arguments. </hh6m><br><br>
                  
                  The <b>String</b> to which the <b>method str.format()</b>
                  is applied
                  looks a bit like the <b>Format Strings</b>
                  used by the <b>Builtin Function print()</b> discussed
                  previously. <br><br>
                  
                  It includes <b>Code Regions</b> in <b>Curly Brackets {}</b> that
                  determine the
                  formatting of the <b>method Arguments</b>.<br><br>
                  
                  The code within the <b>curly brackets</b> has two <b>Fields</b>,
                  separated by a <b>Colon</b> ('<b>:</b>').<br><br>
                  
                  The first <b>Fields</b> 
                  identifies the <b>Argument</b> to which the
                  formatting is to be applied.<br><br>
                  
                  In this first example, the first <b>Field</b>
                  indicates the <b>Argument</b>
                  to which the formatting applies by its <b>Position</b>
                  (starting from <b>0</b>) in the list of items
                  to be formatted.<br><br>
                  
                  The second <b>Fields</b> defines defines
                  the format details, following extremely similar rules to those
                  used by <b>print()</b>.<br><br>
                 
                  Where there is no second <b>Field</b>. a <b>String
                  Argument</b> is assumed.<br><br>

                  <hh6m> str.format() for Keyword Arguments. </hh6m><br><br>
           
                  An alternative to specifying the item to be formatted by
                  its <b>Position</b> in the list of <b>Arguments</b> sent
                  to <b>str.format()</b> is to use <b>Keyword</b>s.<br><br>
                    
                  Each item it the <b>Argument list</b> is prefixed by 
                  a <b>Keyword</b>.<br><br>
                  
                  The <b>Keyword</b> is separated from the
                  item value by an <b>Equals Character</b> ('<b>=</b>').<br><br>
                    
                  The first <b>Field</b> in each <b>Bracketed {} Coding
                  Element</b> of the <b>Format String</b> is a <b>Keyword</b>
                  that identifies the item to be formatted.<br><br>

                  A big advantage of using <b>Keywords</b> is that a single
                  <b>Format String</b> can be used with <b>Argument Lists</b>
                  of varying order.

              <div>
            
                To enable access to a <b>Disk File</b>, you need
                to make a representative  <b>File Object</b>
                (or <b>File Handle</b> as I prefer).<br><br>
            
                In order to make a <b>File Handle</b>, you must use the
                <b>Builtin Function</b>
                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#open"
                 target="_blank"><b>open()</b></a>.<br><br>
             
                Once the <b>File Handle</b> is made, accessing the associated
                <b>Disk File</b> is
                achieved using <b>methods</b> associated with <b>File Objects</b>.<br><br>
            
                A simplifies syntax (that is, enough for the immediate
                needs of this tutorial) for <b>open()</b> is:<br><br>
            
                <b>open(</b><i>&lt;'filename'&gt;</i><b>[</b>&lt;'mode'&gt;</i><b>])</b><br><br>
            
                where <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is an optional
                parameter which is either set to:<br><br>
            
                <ul>
                  <li> '<b>r</b>' - the file is for reading</li>
                  <li> '<b>w</b>' - the file is to be written to</li>
                </ul>
            
                If the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> parameter is omitted, '<b>r</b>' is assumed.<br><br>
            
                For a full description of all you can do with <b>open()</b>,
                take a look at the
                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#open"
                 target="_blank"><b>Manual Page</b></a>, but everything you need
                for now is described above.<br><br>

              <div>

                There a quite a number of <b>File Object methods</b>. You can find a full list

                <p class="hint">
                  It seems odd there is no <b>file.writeline()</b>?<br><br>
                  
                  The clearest explanation (that I am not sure I follow entirely) is
                  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2575619/why-python-language-does-not-have-a-writeln-method"
                   target="_blamk">here</a>.<br><br>
                   
                  I only mention this as I imagine you might spot the lack of symmetry.
                  It really does not matter in the context of what we are trying to achieve.<br><br>
                </p>
                
                With these <b>methods</b>, and the <b>Builtin function open()</b>,
                it is possible to <b>create</b> files, <b>write</b>
                to them and to <b>read</b> from them.<br><br>
                
                This is enough for now, however there is
                more to using <b>Files</b> that is of interest.<br><br>
                
                Further possibilities will be introduced later, as they become needed.<br><br>

                  <li>
                    Create a new <b>File</b> and write into in a minimum of
                    three lines of data.<br>
                    
                    <p class="hint">
                      Use <b>file.write()</b> several times rather

                      The reason for this advice will  become apparent when
                      you have got just a little further on in the tutorial.<br><br>
                      
                      Note: <b>file.write()</b> will not
                      append a <b>newline</b> to the <b>String</b> it outputs.
                      If you want a <b>newline</b>, you must explicitly
                      include it in the <b>String</b>.

                    Read back and print the first line using <b>File.readline()</b>.<br><br>
                   
                    Close the <b>File</b>.<br><br>

                              if not allocated to a <b>Variable</b>.<br><br>

                              when using the <b>Interactive Interpreter</b>.
                              Just assign the <b>file.write()</b> command
                              to a <b>Variable</b>.
                              Looks a bit odd, but it works<br><br>
                              
                              In 
                              <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41149781/how-to-prevent-f-write-to-output-the-number-of-characters-written"
                               target="_blank">one discussion of this issue</a>,
                              the suggestion was to
                              use a <b>Variable</b> called '<b>_</b>' for such purposes.
                              That seems a good idea,
                              so '<b>_</b>' spells "<b>Dustbin</b>" in this context.
                            </li><br>
                            
                            <li>
                              Remember '<b>r</b>' is the default <b>open() Argument</b> for
                              determining the type of access to a <b>File</b>. So<br><br>
                              
                              <b>open("File1")</b><br><br>
                             
                              would have worked fine opening the
                              <b>File</b> here the second time, for <b>Reading Only</b>.<br><br>
                              
                              I like to be careful not to over use defaults,
                              "explicit" is usually easier to read. But, you must choose
                              your own preferences. 
                            </li><br>
                            
                            <li>
                              <b>print()</b> adds a <b>newline</b> to its output.<br><br>
                              
                              So here you get <b>2 newlines</b>!
                              One from the <b>File</b> and one from <b>print()</b>.<br><br>
                              
                              We have covered the way to avoid this!<br><br>

                              So, of course, you all worked this out for yourselves.

                              Just is case, there is no significance in my using two different
                              <b>File Handle Names</b> in this exercise
                              (<b>File1_w</b> and <b>File1_r</b>).
                              I just thought it might be clearer.<br><br>
                              
                              Both represent the same <b>File</b>? Only the access modes differ?
                              Doe the same name make more sense?<br><br>
                              
                              Does it matter? ... Probably not.

                  <li>
                    The topic here is "<b>Calculating
                    Base Composition of a DNA Sequence</b>".<br><br>
                  
                    So first you need a <b>Sequence?</b><br><br>
                  
                    There is a nice one in the file
                    <a href="../Data/sequences.raw"
                     target="_blank"> <b>sequences.raw</b></a>.<br><br>
                  
                    Download it and put it in your <b>Current Working
                    Directory</b>.<br><br>
                  
                    Now compute its <b>Base Composition</b>.<br><br>
                    
                    <div class="pseudos">
                      I suggest the following steps:<br><br>
                    
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Open the <b>Sequence File</b>
                          for <b>Reading</b>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          Read the whole <b>file</b>
                          as a single <b>String</b>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                          Remove the <b>newlines</b>
		                  </li><br>
		                  <li>
		                    Make the <b>String</b> a
		                    uniform (<b>upper</b>?) case
		                  </li><br>
		                  <li>
		                    Count each <b>Base Type</b> separately
		                  </li><br>
		                  <li>
		                    Display <b>Base Composition</b> prettily
		                  </li>
		                </ul><br>
		                
                      This list of steps is a very simple form of
                      <b>pseudo-code</b>.<br><br>
                    
                      It represents a bit of <i>"thinking about
                      the problem"</i> before diving
                      into <b>Python code</b>.<br><br>
                    
                      I strongly suggest that getting the
                      code correct quickly is much more likely
                      following these small steps than it would be
                      trying to go from <i>"end Goal"</i> to code in
                      one hopeful leap.

            <b>A word about Strings</b>:<br><br>
          
            A <b>string</b> is an <b>Immutable</b>
            (remember all the adaptations
            to <b>Strings</b> we considered
            previously resulted in edited
            copies, the original was never
            changed) <b>ordered</b> set of <b>Characters</b>.<br><br>
          
            Therefore, according to the
            definition of a <b>tuple</b> (<b>immutable
            list</b>) set out
            here, a <b>String</b> must be a sort of list.<br><br>
          
            It is, if you adopt the meaning of
            <b>list</b> used in common parlance.
            A <b>String</b> is an <b>Immutable
            list of Characters</b>.<br><br>
          
            But, in <b>Python</b> there is no <b>Data
            type Character</b>. So a <b>String</b> cannot
            be a <b>Python Immutable list</b> as
            what it <b>lists</b>
            does not exist ... in the twisted
            world of <b>Python</b> that is!<br><br>
          
            So, we must accept a <b>String</b> is not
            a <b>Python tuple</b>, it is a <b>Python String</b>.<br><br>
          
            Never mind, some <b>list/tuple</b> functions
            and methods apply also to <b>Strings</b>, For example:<br><br>
          
            The <b>Builtin Function len(</b><i>&lt;str&gt;</i><b>)</b> -
            returns the number of <b>Characters</b>
            in a <b>String</b><br>
            <b>len(</b><i>&lt;list&gt;|&lt;tuple&gt;</i><b>)</b> - returns the number
            of elements of the
            <i>&lt;list&gt;|&lt;tuple&gt</i>.<br><br>
            
            The methods <b>str.count()</b> and <b>str.index()</b>
            have close equivalence for <b>lists</b> and <b>tuples</b>.<br><br>
          
            Any useful functionality that is not available
            can be trivially obtained by creating from the
            <b>String</b> an effectively equivalent
            <i>&lt;list&gt;|&lt;tuple&gt</i>.<br><br>
          
            <span class="command15">
              >>> String00="Its Sunday again"<br>
              >>> tuple00=tuple(String00)<br>
              >>> list00=list(String00)<br>
              >>> print(String00,tuple00,list00,sep='\n')<br>

              ['I', 't', 's', ' ', 'S', 'u', 'n', 'd', 'a', 'y', ' ', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'i', 'n']<br>
              >>> 
            </span><br><br>
          
            I forgot to mention:
          
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>lists</b> are enclosed
                by <b>Square Brackets []</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>tuples</b> are enclosed
                by <b>Round Brackets ()</b>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
          
            The <b>list</b> is a <b>list</b>, <b><i>NOT</i></b> of <b>Characters</b>!!,
            but of <b>Single Character Strings</b>.<br>
            The <b>tuple</b> is a <b>tuple</b>, <b><i>NOT</i></b> of <b>Characters</b>!!,
            but of <b>Single Character Strings</b>.<br><br>
          
            Whilst your <b>String Data</b> is masquerading
            as a <b>list</b> or <b>tuple</b>, you have access
            to the full range of <i>&lt;list&gt;|&lt;tuple&gt</i>;
            <b>Functionality</b>.<br><br>
          
            Of course, when you are done, you
            can easily convert back to a <b>String</b>.<br><br>
          
            <span class="command15">

            <b>''.join(tuple00)</b>??? Yes, sorry about
            that. It gets explain later honest.
            For now, it is just a jolly fine way
            of making <b>Strings</b> from <b>tuples</b> (and <b>lists</b>).<br><br>
          
            Finally consider. <b>DNA</b> and <b>Protein Sequence</b>,
            or one sort of the other, form a substantial
            portion of <b>Bioinformatics Data</b>.
            <b>Sequences</b> are <b>Strings</b>, as far as <b>Python</b>
            is concerned.
            Being able to process <b>Strings</b> in as
            many ways as possible is sure to be vital!<br><br>
           
            Hopefully, via <b>Exercises</b> and <b>Examples</b> that
            follow, this claim can be substantiated.<br><br>

              <hh5m>list definition</hh5m><br><br>
            
              A <b>list</b> is an ordered, mutable set of
              <b>Data Objects</b>.
              <b>List</b> elements may be of a variety of
              suitable <b>Python type</b>.<br><br>
            
              Just in case, being <b>mutable</b> means
              a <b>list</b> may be altered.
              That is, items in the <b>list</b> may be
              replaced, removed or added.<br><br>
              
              Informally, a <b>list Object</b> has the form:<br><br>
            
              <i>[&lt;list_Item00&gt;,&lt;list_Item01&gt;,&lt;list_Item02&gt;,
              ... ]</i><br><br>
              
              where a "<i>&lt;list_Item&gt;</i>" could be any of
              many different <b>Python types</b> (<b>int</b>,
              <b>float</b>, <b>bool</b> ...). For example:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[2, 5, 7.129,
              "Mellow Yellow", True]</b><br><br>
            
              A <b>list</b> can even include a <b>list</b>
              (or similar) as an element! For example:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[44, [1, 2, 3, 4],
              66, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]</b><br><br>
            
              The number of elements in a <b>list</b> can
              vary between <b>0</b> and <b>lots</b>.<br><br>
            
              A <b>list</b> with no elements is called the
              "<b>Empty List</b>" and looks like this:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>[]</b><br><br>

              <hh5m>list creation</hh5m><br><br>
                       
              Like most <b>Python Data Objects</b>, <b>list Objects</b>
              are commonly create by <b>Simple Assignment</b>.<br><br>
            
              <span class="command">
                >>> List_Empty=[]<br>
                >>> List_ints=[1,2,3,4,5]<br>
                >>> List_mixed=[1,2.337,"abcedf"]<br>
                >>> List_of_lists=[[1,2,3],['a',3.4,99],['Muddy',"Waters"]]<br>
                >>> print(List_Empty,List_ints,List_mixed,List_of_lists,sep='\n')<br>
                []<br>
                [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
                [1, 2.337, 'abcedf']<br>
                [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 3.4, 99], ['Muddy', 'Waters']]<br>
                >>>
	           </span><br><br>
	         
	           Alternatively, a <b>list</b> can be created by the
	           conversion of a <b>Data Object</b> of suitable type
	           (for example a <b>String</b>), using
	           the <b>Builtin Function list()</b>.<br><br>
	         
              <span class="command">
                >>> List_from_String=list("abcwxyz")<br>
                >>> List_from_String<br>
                ['a', 'b', 'c', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']<br>
                >>> 
	           </span><br><br>
              
              <hh5m>list Builtin Functions</hh5m><br><br>
            
              I think it useful just to mention only two <b>Builtin
              Functions</b> at this point. They are:<br><br>
            
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>list()</b>, which casts <b>Data Objects</b> of
                  other compatible <b>type</b> into <b>lists</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  <b>len()</b>, which returns the number of              
                  <b>Characters</b> in a <b>String</b> the number of
                  <b>elements</b> in a <b>list</b> ... .
                  Basically it returns 
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality"
                   target="_blank"><b>cardinality</b></a>
                  for any <b>Data Type</b> where that concept is relevant.
                </li>
              </ul><br>
            
              <hh5m>list methods</hh5m><br><br>
            
              You can discover all the <b>methods</b> for the <b>class list</b> by typing:<br><br>
            
              &emsp;<b>help(list)</b><br><br>

                    Of all the <b>list methods</b> in the table above, how

                    Why do you need a <b>list.copy() method</b>?<br><br>
                    
                    Surely, you could make a copy of a
                    <b>list</b>, or anything come to that, using
                    a simple <b>Assignment Statement</b>?<br><br>

                        <hh5m>Explanation:</hh5m><br><br>
                        
                        The explanation must start by knowing a little
                        more about the way <b>Python
                        Variables</b> work.<br><br>
                        
                        Considering them as <i>"Boxes in which Values
                        are stored"</i> is not quite as
                        true in <b>Python</b>
                        as it is in some other Languages.<br><br>
                        
                        In <b>Python</b> it is more accurate to think of
                        <b>Data Values</b> and <b>Data Variables</b>
                        as being a
                        little more independent of each other.<br><br>
                        
                        A <b>Python Variable</b> is a reference
                        (or pointer) to an independent
                        <b>Data Item</b> rather than a container
                        enclosing a private copy of a
                        <b>Value</b>.<br><br>
               
                        <img src="Images/list-create.png"
                             alt="Fiddle!"
                             class="centimg"
                             style="background:White;
                                    border-style: solid;
                                    border-width: 1px;"><br><br>
                       
                        There is no reason that <b>2</b>
                        (or more) <b>Python Variables</b> should not
                        reference the same <b>Data Value</b>!<br><br>
                        
                        This is exactly what we caused
                        to happen when we copied the
                        <b>Original list</b> by
                        <b>Assignment</b>.<br><br>
                       
                        Copying by <b>Assignment</b> does not
                        duplicate the <b>Data Value</b>.
                        It duplicates the <b>Data Variable</b> which
                        is a <b>pointer</b> to the <b>Data Value</b>.<br><br>
                        
                        So, in a nutshell, you have <b>TWO
                        Data Variables</b> both of which point
                        to the same <b>Data Item</b>.<br><br>
                       
                        Anything you do to <b>List00</b> must also
                        affect <b>List00_Assigned_Copy</b>
                        (and vice versa).
                        They both point to the same <b>Data</b>.
                        Effectively, they are the same!<br><br>

                        Using the <b>list.copy()</b> method, on
                        the other hand, <b><i>does</i></b> make an
                        entirely separate version of a <b>list</b>.<br><br>
                     
                        Editing either or both <b>List00</b> and
                        <b>List00_method_copy</b> will cause the two
                        <b>lists</b> to diverge.<br><br>
                    
                        <b>List00</b> and <b>List00_Assigned_Copy</b> will,
                        of course, always be identical
                        however you edit any of the
                        <b>3</b> apparent <b>lists</b>
                        (really just <b>2 lists</b>

                      As previously discussed, "<b>==</b>"

				                        As discussed previously, when a "new <b>list</b>" is

				                        Name</b> to another (as here). No new <b>list
				                        Data Object</b> is actually created. Instead,
				                        a copy is made of the <b>Reference</b> (or <b>Pointer</b>)
				                        which is the <b>Value</b> of the
				                        copied <b>Variable Name</b>.<br><br>
				                        
				                        The result of copying by
				                        assignment is the duplication of the

				                        Accordingly, all three <b>list Variable

				                        They will all register as equal whether
				                        compared with "<b>==</b>", "<b>is</b>" or any
				                        combination of the two.

              <hh5m>tuple definition</hh5m><br><br>
            
              A <b>tuple</b> is an ordered, immutable set of
              <b>Data Objects</b>.
              <b>List</b> elements may be of a variety of
              suitable <b>Python type</b>.<br><br>
            
              Just in case, being <b>immutable</b> means
              a <b>tuple</b> may <b><i>not</i></b> be altered.
              That is, items in the <b>tuple</b> must
              remain as initially defined for the entire
              life of the <b>tuple</b>.<br><br>
            
              Informally, a <b>tuple Value</b> is of the form:<br><br>
            
              <i>(&lt;tuple_Item00&gt;,&lt;tuple_Item01&gt;,&lt;tuple_Item02&gt;,
              ... )</i><br><br>
            
              where a "<i>&lt;tuple_Item&gt;</i>" could be any of
              many different <b>Python types</b> (<b>int</b>,
              <b>float</b>, <b>bool</b> ...). For example:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(2, 5, 7.129, "Mellow Yellow", True)</b><br><br>
            
              A <b>tuple</b> can even include <b>lists</b> and/or <b>tuples</b>
              (or similar) as an element! For example:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(44, [1, 2, 3, 4], 66, ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'))</b><br><br>
            
              The number of elements in a <b>tuple</b> can
              vary between <b>0</b> and <b>lots</b>.<br><br>
            
              A <b>tuple</b> with no elements is called the
              "<b>Empty Tuple</b>" and looks like this:<br><br>
            
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>()</b><br>
            
              <p class="hint">
                Being <b>immutable</b>, a <b>tuple</b> will take up less
                memory that an equivalent list.<br><br>
              
                In particular, whereas a <b>tuple</b> is of fixed
                memory requirement,
                an equivalent list will allow extra memory for
                possible expansion.<br><br>
              
                Also due to its <b>immutability</b>, access to a <b>tuple</b>
                is faster
                than to an equivalent <b>list</b>.<br><br>
              
                Conceptually, the only real difference between
                <b>lists</b> an <b>tuples</b> is <b>mutability</b>.<br><br>
              
                However, in the ways <b>Python</b> chooses to implement
                these two different <b>Data types</b>, there are greater,
                more profound, distinctions.<br><br>
              
                There are many occasions where either
                a <b>list</b> or a <b>tuple</b> would suit the
                purpose of a <b>program</b>.<br><br>
              
                In general, it is thought best to use a <b>tuple</b>
                unless <b>mutability</b> is <b>imperative</b>.
              </p>
  
              <hh5m>tuple creation</hh5m><br><br>
                       
              Like most <b>Python Data Objects</b>, <b>tuple Objects</b>
              are commonly create by <b>Simple Assignment</b>.<br><br>
              
              <span class="command">
                >>> Tuple_Empty=()<br>
                >>> Tuple_ints=(1,2,3,4,5)<br>
                >>> Tuple_mixed=(1,2.337,"abcedf")<br>
                >>> Tuple_with_lists=([1,2,3],('a',3.4,99),('Muddy',"Waters"))<br>
                >>> print(Tuple_Empty,Tuple_ints,Tuple_mixed,Tuple_with_lists,sep='\n')<br>
                ()<br>
                (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)<br>
                (1, 2.337, 'abcedf')<br>

                >>> 
	           </span><br><br>
	         
	           Alternatively, a <b>tuple</b> can be created by the
	           conversion of a <b>Data Object</b> of suitable type
	           (for example a <b>String</b> or a <b>list</b>), using
	           the <b>Builtin Function tuple()</b>.<br><br>

              <hh5m>tuple Builtin Functions</hh5m><br><br>
            
              I think it useful just to mention only two <b>Builtin
              Functions</b> at this point. They are:<br><br>
            
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>tuple()</b>, which casts <b>Data Objects</b> of
                  other compatible <b>type</b> into <b>tuples</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  <b>len()</b>, which returns the number of              
                  <b>Characters</b> in a <b>String</b> the number of
                  <b>elements</b> in a <b>list</b> or <b>tuple</b> ... .
                  Basically it returns 
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality"
                   target="_blank"><b>cardinality</b></a>
                  for any <b>Data Type</b> where that concept is relevant.
                </li>
              </ul><br>
            
              <hh5m>tuple methods</hh5m><br><br>
            
              You can discover all the <b>methods</b> for the <b>class tuple</b> by typing:<br><br>
            
              &emsp;<b>help(tuple)</b><br><br>
            
              at the <b>Interpreter</b>.
              Try it, ignoring for now all the methods
              with identifiers that begin and end with '__'<br><br>
            
              <img class="centimg"
                   src="Images/tuple_methods.png"
                   alt="Oh Dear!"><br><br>
                 
              Just <b>2</b>! Both shared with <b>list</b>.
              In fact, these are <b>2</b> of the <b>3
              list methods</b> that
              were determined (see <b>list</b>
              exercises) to be the only <b>list methods</b> that
              would work on <b>immutable lists</b>
              (that is to say, <b>tuples</b>).<br><br>
            
              So, for <b>tuples</b> the <b>method table</b>
              is a rather thin affair!<br><br>

                      One might speculate (correctly) the existence

                      <div class="hint">
                        According to the "<b>Manual Pages</b>l" I referenced.<br><br>
                       
                        <i>"Rather than being a function, list is actually

                        <b>Tuple_Empty</b> is fine, but all the <b>Tuple_One_*</b> attempts have
                        taken on the <b>type</b> of the <b>Single tuple Element</b>?<br><br>

                          Of course this is the case. The <b>Interpreter</b> sees <b>(5)</b>,

                          <b>(5)</b> is ambiguous. It could be:<br><br>

                            The most obvious is to use another type

                            You cannot use <b><></b> because the <b>Interpreter</b>
                            will get confused as '<b><</b>' (<b>less
                            than</b>) and '<b>></b>' (<b>greater than</b>)

                            Next most obvious is to first make a single

                            <b>Python</b> clearly agrees and declares that if

                        You could have just used a

                    Why is there no <b>tuple.copy()

                    After all, it was spotted in the
                    list exercises as <b>1</b> of
                    <b>3 list methods</b>
                    that should work fine with <b>immutable

                    <b>tuples</b>).<br><br>

                      <div class="answer">
                      
                        There is no <b>tuple.copy()</b>,
                        not because
                        it would not work, but because
                        it is not needed!<br><br>
                    
                        For <b>mutable lists</b>,
                        <b>copy()</b> provides a means to
                        duplicate the <b>list</b> to allow
                        it to be transformed
                        into a different form from
                        the original.<br><br>
                    
                        But, even if you allow <b>tuples</b>
                        to be copied, you
                        cannot edit the copies <b><i>OR</i></b>
                        the original because
                        they are both <b>immutable</b>!<br><br>
                    
                        So there is no reason to make a genuine
                        <b>copy</b> a <b>tuple</b>.<br><br>
                    
                        So there is no need for a

                        First, I need to register mild objection
                        to the term <i>"sequence"</i>.
                        Surely this implies the elements of the
                        <b>tuple</b> are arranged in some
                        computable order? A pattern?,
                        A mathematical series??<br><br>
                      
                        This is not so!<br><br>
                      
                        Far worse, the suggestion is that all the
                        elements of the <b>tuple</b> must be <b>immutable</b>?<br><br>
                      
                        This is most certainly <b><i>not</i></b> true!
                        If it were true, a <b>tuple</b>
                        could not include a <b>list</b> amongst its elements.
                        But it can! <b><i>AND</i></b> that <b>list</b>
                        can be edited whilst still an element of the
                        <b>tuple</b>. This I will illustrate:<br><br>
                      
                        <span class="command">
                          >>> #<br>
                          ... # Make a tuple including a mutable list<br>

                          >>> Tuple_with_list=(1,2,3,[1,2,3],'abc')<br>
                          >>> type(Tuple_with_list)<br>
                          &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;<br>
                          >>> Tuple_with_list<br>

                          >>> <br>
                          >>> #<br>
                          ... # Edit the list in situ<br>
                          ... #<br>
                          ... <br>
                          >>> Tuple_with_list[3].reverse()<br>
                          >>> <br>
                          >>> #<br>
                          >>> # Display tuple with edited element<br>
                          ... #<br>

                        </span><br><br>

                        I suspect what these chaps meant to say was:<br><br>

                        <i>"A tuple is an immutable ordered set of Python objects."</i><br><br>

                        Picky? No, I do not think so!
                        My version lacks rigour but is correct.
                        Their version is simply wrong!

              "The <b>range type</b> <i>represents</i>
              an <b>Immutable Sequence of Integers</b>."<br><br>
              
              This sounds a bit like a subset of
              <b>tuples</b> at first reading,
              but the word "<i>represents</i>"
              is crucial.<br><br>
             
              A range is not a <b>tuple</b>,
              but it encapsulates all the
              functionality of a numeric <b>tuple</b>
              without the potentially
              huge memory overheads.<br><br>
              
              Note also that the elements of a <b>range</b>
              cannot just be a jumble of unconnected
              numbers, as can be represented by a <b>tuple</b>.
              The elements of a <b>range</b> must form a
              well define "<b>Sequence</b>".
              For example, <i>"All the even Integers from 2
              to 42, inclusive"</i>
            
              Elements of a <b>range</b> can be accessed
              by <b>index</b>, in the same way
              that elements of a <b>tuple</b> can.<br><br>
              
              However, the elements of a <b>range</b> cannot
              be displayed directly by <b>print()</b>
              (as can those of a <b>tuple</b>). They are
              simply not directly available. The whole point of a
              <b>range</b> is that it is not unfolded into
              a memory consuming
              <b>tuple</b>, it is instead a set of
              rules (the "<b>Sequence</b>" specification that defines
              the <b>range</b>)from which
              elements can be determined as required.<br><br>
              
              A saving in memory at the cost of
              some computational overhead.<br><br>
              
              In order to print out all the elements of a
              <b>range</b> in one go, it is
              necessary to <b>cast</b>
              it to a <b>list</b> or <b>tuple</b>
              first.<br><br>
              
              <hh5m>range creation</hh5m><br><br>
             
              <b>range</b> objects can only be created using the
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#range"

              With just one <b>Parameter</b>:<br><br>

              of <b>1</b> up to <b>Size-1</b>.<br><br>

                The nature of a <b>range</b> is something
                that changed radically between
                <b>Version 2</b> and <b>Version 3</b> of <b>Python</b>.<br><br>
                
                In <b>Python Version 2</b>, the
                <b>range()</b> function
                simply returned a <b>list</b>.<br><br>
                
                Conceptually much simpler for the user, but the
                developers of <b>Python 3</b>
                clearly opined that the 
                gain in memory efficiency was worth the
                introduction of the <b>range type</b>.<br><br>
                
                So we users have to struggle a

                understand exactly what is going

                a little, thinking of a <b>range</b>
                as a <b>tuple</b> (rather
                than a <b>list</b>) is sloppy,
                but it only breaks down
                if you try to <b>print</b> the
                <b>range</b> out without
                first casting in to a <b>list</b>

              Most crucially <b>range()</b>, of course,
              which has been outlined
              in the <i>"creation"</i> section.<br><br>

              There is no <b>Builtin Function</b> to <b>cast</b>
              any other <b>Python Data type</b> to a <b>range</b>.
              There is no other <b>Python Data type</b> that
              it makes sense to <b>cast</b> to a <b>range</b>!<br><br>
              
              <b>len()</b>, which returns the number of              
              <b>Characters</b> in a <b>String</b> the number of
              <b>elements</b> in a <b>list</b>, <b>tuple</b> or <b>range</b> ... .
              Basically it returns 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality"
               target="_blank"><b>cardinality</b></a>
              for any <b>Data Type</b> where that concept is relevant.<br><br>

              Exactly as for <b>tuples</b>, unsurprisingly.<br><br>
              
              I could find no informative <b>URLs</b>
              for the <b>range methods</b>.
              I am not sure why, but the message
              is very similar to
              that for <b>tuples</b> and <b>lists</b>.<br><br>
              
              I used <b>help(range)</b> to check the list
              below is comprehensive.
              Ignoring all the tricky methods that
              begin "<b>__</b>", I found:<br><br>

                        Maybe I would be a little kinder and suggest it could

              Two definitions are required to start this
              discussion. Both are set out quite readably
              <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator"
               target="_blank">here</a>.
              
              I offer slightly less complete, less formal,
              less rigorous, but adequate versions as follows:<br><br>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An <b>iterable</b> is an ordered set of
                  objects (e.g. <b>list</b>, <b>tuple</b>,
                  <b>range</b>) from which an
                  <b>iterator</b> can be generated using the
                  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#iter"
                   target="_blank"><b>Builtin Function iter()</b></a>.

                <li>
                  An <b>iterator</b> is an object, associate
                  with a particular <b>iterable</b>,
                  that enables the elements
                  of that <b>iterable</b> to be delivered, one at a time,
                  in order, by serial
                  applications of the
                  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#next"

              <b>iterators</b> form  family of <b>Python types</b> including:<br><br>
                
              <ul>
                <li><b>list_iterator</b></li><br>

                <li><b>range_iterator</b></li><br>
              </ul>
                
              The primary use of <b>iterators</b> is to control
              tasks that require <b>iterative execution</b>.
              That is, <b>repeated execution</b>, possible once
              for each element of an <b>iterable</b> object?<br><br>
                
              <b>iterators</b> will be very evident in this

                        Just leaving the system to explode
                        when things go wrong is not really
                        acceptable. Surely some effort should
                        be made to trap <b>Exceptions</b>
                        before they unceremoniously terminate
                        a program's execution?<br><br>
                      
                        <b>Python</b> offers a device to allow a command
                        to be run in a fashion
                        that does capture any <b>Exceptions</b> and
                        provide for them to be dealt with in
                        a civilised fashion.<br><br>
                      
                        It is described fully

                         taget="_blank">here</a>. I will offer
                        a simple example as part of this <b>Answer</b>.<br><br>
                      
                        The approach is primarily based on
                        the use of the two <b>Python

                        <i>&lt;Exception_Type&gt;</i> is the type
                        of <b>Exception</b> against which the code is guarding.
                      
                        It is possible to specify more than one
                        <i>&ly;Exception_Type&gt;</i> by
                        substitution a <b>tuple</b> of all
                        the possibilities where the one

                        If <i>&lt;Exception_Type&gt;</i> is omitted
                        altogether, any <i>&lt;Exception_Type&gt;</i>
                        will cause the <b>except</b> clause to be executed.
                     
                        If, when the code is executed, there is no
                        <b>Exception</b>, the
                        <b>Indented Code Block</b>
                        following the <b>try</b> keyword is executed.
                        The <b>Indented Code Block</b> following the
                        <b>except</b> keyword is ignored.<br><br>
                      
                        If there is an <b>Exception</b> of the type(s)
                        specified, the
                        <b>Indented Code Block</b>
                        following the <b>except</b> keyword is executed.
                        The <b>Indented Code Block</b> following the

                        If there is an <b>Exception</b>, but not of the
                        type specified, execution ceases in a confusion
                        of <b>Error Message</b>.<br><br>
                      
                        The <b>Indentations</b> that determine the <b>Code
                        Blocks</b> must be precise (here and everywhere
                        else the are employed by <b>Python</b>).<br><br>
                      
                        The rule is that exactly <b>4 Spaces</b> be used.
                        Alternatively,
                        a single <b>tab</b> will work ... usually.
                        Most experienced <b>Python</b> programmers recommend

                    Would it work if you overwrote the
                    <b>iterable Variable</b> with the
                    <b>iterator</b>?<br><br>
                    
                    If it does, do you think this might
                    be a good idea?<br><br>

                        </span><br><br>
                        
                        Well clearly the answer is
                        "Yes, it is fine to overwrite the
                        <b>tuple</b> with its own <b>iterator</b>"??<br><br>
                        
                        But how can that work? If the <b>tuple</b>
                        is destroyed, what is the <b>iterator</b>
                        iterating along?<br><br>
                        
                        Aha! but remember, in <b>Python</b>,
                        <b>Variables</b> contain <b>References</b>
                        (or <b>Pointers</b>) to data items.
                        Not the data items themselves.<br><br>
                        
                        So, the <b>tuple</b> still exists, and
                        the <b>iterator</b>, equally clearly,
                        knows where it is and can still
                        access its elements.<br><br>
                        
                        Jolly good ... but it is no longer
                        accessible any other way. It cannot be
                        accessed by <b>index</b>, or
                        printed out whole.<br><br>
                        
                        The <b>iterator</b> cannot be refreshed.<br><br>
                        
                        I conclude, that while it is interesting
                        that overwriting the <b>tuple</b> with
                        its <b>iterator</b>, sort of, worked.
                        It was a thoroughly stupid thing to do!<br><br>
                        
                        So there!

              A <b>Dictionary</b> is a <b>Mutable Ordered</b>
              set of <b>Distinct Keyword/Value</b> pairs.<br>
              The <b>Keys</b> of a <b>Dictionary</b> are associated
              (or mapped), one to one, to its <b>Values</b>.<br>
              They <b>Values</b> of a <b>Dictionary</b> are
              accessed by reference to their <b>Key</b>.<br>
              The <b>Keys</b> of a <b>dictionary</b> must
              clearly be distinct.<br>
              Equally clearly, the <b>Values</b> of a
              <b>Dictionary</b> need not be distinct.<br>
              The <b>Keys</b> of a <b>Dictionary</b>
              can be any <b>Python Data type</b>
              from which a reference to a <b>Value</b>
              can be generated.<br>
              The <b>Values</b> of a <b>Dictionary</b> can be any
              <b>Python Data type</b>.<br><br>
              
              Happily, once you actually make and use one,
              will seem <b><i>MUCH</i></b> more simple than the mass of
              words above! They are very closely analogous
              to conventional (as in printed) <b>Dictionaries</b>
              except in the way they are <b>Ordered</b>.<br><br>
              
              A <b>Python Dictionary</b> has the form:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<i>{&lt;Key:Value&gt;, &lt;Key:Value&gt;,
              &lt;Key:Value&gt;, &lt;Key:Value&gt;, &lt;Key:Value&gt;, ... }</i><br><br>
              
              The number of <i>&lt;Key:Value&gt;</i>
              elements can vary between <b>0</b> and <b>Lots</b>.<br><br>
              
              An <b>Empty Dictionary</b> is therefore represented thus:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<b>{}</b><br><br>
	             
              For example, a <b>Dictionary</b>
              for associating <b>Base Codes</b> with
              <b>Base Names</b> might be: <br><br>

              &emsp;<b>{'A':'Adenine', 'C':'Cytosine','G':'Guanine','T':'Thymine'}</b><br><br>
              
              Useful(?), should one forget what the letters mean?<br><br>
              
              <b>Dictionary Values</b> are accessed using their
              <b>Keys</b> (rather
              than positional Indices), so, should the              
              <b>Variable Name</b> assigned to the
              example <b>Dictionary</b> above be <b>Base_Resolver</b>:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<b>Base_Resolver['A']</b><br><br>
              
              would return <b>'Adenine'</b>.<br><br>

		              <b>A Note on the Ordering of a Python Dictionary</b><br><br>
		             
		              Until very recently, <b>Dictionaries</b> were
		              regarded as <b>Unordered</b>.<br><br>
		              
		              Indeed the <b>Key-Value</b> pairs do not need to be
		              in any specific <b>Order</b> to enable their prime function.
		              That is, to access a <b>Value</b> by quoting its <b>Key</b>
		              (as you might use a word, "<b>Key</b>", to access a meaning,
		              "<b>Value</b>", in a conventional <b>Dictionary</b>)<br><br>
		              
		              <b>Python</b> uses the <b>Dictionary Key</b>
		              (unlike with a conventional <b>Dictionary</b>, in a fashion
		              that does not require the <b>Keys</b> to <b>Ordered</b>)
		              to find and deliver the corresponding <b>Dictionary Value</b>.<br><br>
		              
		              However, as I hope will be illustrated in an
		              exercise (the one involving the use of <b>dict.popitem()</b>),
		              <b>Dictionaries</b> do have a logical
		              <b>Order</b> for their <b>Key-Value Pairs</b>.<br><br>
		              
		              From <b>Python 3.6</b> onwards <b>Dictionaries</b> were
		              <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6?rq=1"
                 target="_blank">declared to be Ordered</a>,
		              seemingly without too much guarantee of consistency!?<br><br>
		              
		              Happily, since then the move has been made
		              <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html"
                 target="_blank">"officially" part of the <b>Python Language Specification</b></a>
                and so should be reliable in all <b>Python Implementations</b>,
                from <b>Python 3.7</b> (current stable version) onwards.<br><br>

		              A <b>Python Dictionary</b> is implemented as a <b>Stack</b>,
		              which has a natural <b>L</b>ast <b>I</b>n <b>F</b>irst
		              <b>O</b>ut (<b>LIFO</b>) order of access.<br><br>
		              
		              Think of the <b>Dictionary</b> as a tower (<b>Stack</b>)
		              of <b>Key-Value Pairs</b>.<br><br>
		              
		              New <b>Dictionary</b> elements (<b>Key-Value Pairs</b>)
		              are added to ("<b>pushed</b> on") the <b>Dictionary</b>
		              by being placed on the top of the tower.<br><br>
		              
		              When <b>Dictionary</b> elements are removed,
		              the easiest (only sensible?)
		              way is to remove ("<b>pop</b>") them from the top of the tower.<br><br>
		              
		              That is, the <b>Last One</b> to be added is
		              the <b>First One</b> to be removed
		              ... hence <b>L</b>ast <b>I</b>n
		              <b>F</b>irst <b>O</b>ut (<b>LIFO</b>).<br><br>

              Like most <b>Python Data Objects</b>, <b>dict Objects</b>
              are commonly create by <b>Simple Assignment</b>, as illustrated
              above (<b>Base_Resolver</b>) and once more, for luck, here:<br><br>
            
              <span class="command15">
                >>> Dict_Empty={}<br>
                >>> Dict_BaseType={'A':'Typo', 'C':'Pyrimidine', 'G':'Purine', 'T':'Pyrimidine', 'A':'Purine'}<br>
                >>> print(Dict_Empty,Dict_BaseType,sep='\n')<br>
                {}<br>
                {'A': 'Purine', 'C': 'Pyrimidine', 'G': 'Purine', 'T': 'Pyrimidine'}<br>
                >>> 
	             </span><br><br>
	             
	             Note that duplication of <b>Key</b> ('<b>A</b>' in this case) was
	             not tolerated, but duplication of <b>Value</b> was accepted.<br><br>
	             
	             Note that the second <b>Value</b> assigned to the
	             <b>Key</b> '<b>A</b>' was accepted and used to overwrite
	             the first <b>Value</b>. However, the Key ('<b>A</b>')
	             retained its
	             initial position.<br><br>
	         
	             Alternatively, <b>Dictionaries</b> can be
	             created using the <b>Builtin Function dict()</b>.<br><br>
	             
	             How, is explained in the next subsection.<br><br>

              <hh5m>Dictionary Builtin Functions</hh5m><br><br>

              As a <b>Dictionary</b> certainly has
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality"
               target="_blank"><b>cardinality</b></a>,
              <b>len()</b>, will work. It simply
              returns the number of <b>Key-Value Pairs</b>
              in the <b>Dictionary</b>.<br><br>
              
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict"
               target="_blank">dict()</a> is a
              function to create or extend <b>Python Dictionaries</b>.<br><br>
               
              A simplified syntax for <b>dict()</b> is:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<i>dict(**kwargs)</i><br><br>
              
              where <i>**kwargs</i> translates to
              <i>"Between <b>0</b> and <b>Lots</b>
              of "<b>Keyword Arguments</b>"</i>.<br><br>
              
              A 
              <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/"
	              target="_blank">Keyword Argument</a> being an
              assignment of a <b>Value</b> to a
              <b>Variable Name</b> (e.g. <b>X=47</b>).<br><br>
              
              So the command:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<b>dict(a=1,b=2)</b><br><br>
              
              Might be read as <i>"Make me a <b>Dictionary</b>
              in which <b>a</b> (the <b>Key</b>) is associated with
              <b>1</b> (the <b>Value</b>), and <b>b</b> is similarly
              associated with <b>2</b>"</i>.<br><br>
              
              As <b>dict()</b> knows that <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>
              are <b>Variable Names</b> that are to be used
              as <b>Key</b>s, they:<br><br>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b><i>must not</i></b> be enclosed in quotes!<br><br>
                  
                  If they are (e.g. <b>"a"=93</b>,
                  or <b>'r'=32</b>), the <b>Interpreter</b> will
                  imagine you wish to assign
                  a <b>Value</b> to a <b>String</b>,
                  which does not make sense.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  can be the same as <b>Variable
                  Names</b> already in use as there
                  is no confusion once they are
                  incorporated into the new
                  <b>Dictionary</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  must obey the normal rules
                  for <b>Variable Names</b> (e.g.
                  no <b>Reserved Words</b>)
                </li>
              </ul><br>
              
              Try it:<br><br>

              The <b>Reserved Word</b> "<b>or</b>" is not

                94<br>
                >>> 
              </span><br><br>
               
              That is better! Note that the <b>Variable c</b>
              set to <b>94</b> is distinct from the
              <b>Variable c</b> set to <b>3</b> as an
              <b>Argument</b> for <b>dict()</b>.<br><br>
               
              A marginally expanded syntax for <b>dict()</b> is:<br><br>
              
	             &emsp;<i>dict(&lt;dict&gt;, **kwargs)</i><br><br>
	             
	             Everything works as before except the
	             <b>Keyword Arguments</b> are appended
	             to the current
	             contents of the <b>Dictionary</b> that is
	             the first <b>dict() Argument</b>.<br><br>
	             
	             <span class="command">
		              >>> Dictionary00=dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)<br>
	               >>> Dictionary01=dict(Dictionary00,aa=11,
	               bb=22, cc=33, dd=44)<br>
	               >>> print(Dictionary00, Dictionary01, sep='\n')<br>
	               {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}<br>
	               {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'aa':
	               11, 'bb': 22, 'cc': 33, 'dd': 44}<br>
	               >>>
	             </span><br><br>
	
	             Expanding the syntax for <b>dict()</b>
	             once more, just slightly, one gets:<br><br>
	               
		            &emsp;<i>dict(&lt;iterable&gt;, **kwargs)</i><br><br>
	             
              Well, a <b>Dictionary</b> is <b>iterable</b>, so
              this syntax includes the one
              we have already discussed.<br><br>
              
              <b>lists</b> and <b>tuples</b> are also
              <b>iterables</b>, so this syntax suggests that
              the first <b>Argument</b> of
              <b>dict()</b> can be a <b>list</b>
              or a <b>tuple</b>
              (or any other <b>iterable</b>,
              but <b>lists</b> and <b>tuples</b> are
              enough for now).<br><br>
              
              This is true, <b><i>BUT</i></b>,
              what the syntax definition above does not
              stipulate is that only <b>iterables</b>
              that can represent a series of
              <b>Key-Value Pairs</b> will work.<br><br>
              
              Such an <b>itereable</b>
              (<b>dict</b>, <b>list</b> or <b>tuple</b>
              if you prefer) must:<br><br>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  have elements that are all <b>iterables</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  each element <b>iterable</b> must have
                  exactly <b>2</b> elements that can represent
                  a legitimate <b>Dictionary Key-Value Pair</b>.
                </li>
              </ul><br>
              
              This is trivially true if the <b>iterable</b> is a <b>dict</b>.<br><br>
              
              Other possibilities include:<br><br>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  a <b>list</b> of <b>2 element lists</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  a <b>list</b> of <b>2 element tuples</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  a <b>tuple</b> of <b>2 element lists</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  a <b>tuple</b> of <b>2 element tuples</b>
                </li>
              </ul><br>

	             Making a <b>Dictionary</b> purely from
	             <b>Keyword Arguments</b> restricts the
	             <b>Dictionary Keys</b> to objects that
	             follow the rules for <b>Variable Names</b>.<br><br>
	             
	             Using an <b>iterable Argument</b> for <b>dict()</b>
	             allows <b>Dictionary Keys</b> to be
	             anything that can be used to
	             generate a reference to its associated <b>Value</b>.<br><br>
	             
	             Hopefully, I will think of an
	             exercise to illustrate an occasion for
	             which this restriction is an issue.<br><br>

                        The <b>Builtin Function dict()</b> retains
                        the order of element entry
                        as it makes the <b>Dictionary</b>.<br><br>
                        
                        Note the detection of duplicate
                        <b>Key</b> (<b>'two'</b> in this case). It is
                        shown that the <b>Value</b> of the last of a
                        set of duplicate <b>Keys</b> is the one
                        that is accepted, even though the
                        position of the <b>Key-Value Pair</b>
                        is determined by the first of the duplicates.<br><br>
                        
                        As expected, there are no problems using <b>iter()</b>
                        to create an <b>Iterator</b> for <b>Dictionary00</b>.<br><br>
                        
                        The <b>Builtin Function next()</b>
                        reads the <b>Dictionary Keys</b>
                        back from first to last (in terms of their
                        insertion into the <b>Dictionary</b>). That
                        is in <b>F</b>irst <b>I</b>n <b>F</b>irst
                        <b>O</b>ut (<b>FIFO</b>) order.<br><br>
                        
                        This appears to contradict the assertion that
                        <b>Dictionaries</b> are held in a 
                        <b>Stack</b> like fashion
                        and that <b>LIFO</b> access is the way to go.
                        It does not!<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Python</b> knows where the bottom of
                        the <b>Stack</b> is and
                        it knows where the top of the stack is. It can read
                        in either direction with equal ease.<br><br>
                        
                        The problem arises when a <b><i>destructive</i></b>
                        read ("<b>pop</b>") is required. Now the element
                        must not only be read, but also removed!<br><br>
                        
                        The position of bottom of the stack must not be altered!
                        It is the start of the memory allocated to the
                        <b>Stack</b> and must remain constant.
                        So, if you remove the
                        first <b>Stack</b> element,
                        you have to shuffle down all the others,
                        which is a huge overhead.<br><br>
                        
                        If you remove elements in <b>LIFO</b> order
                        (from top to bottom) each removal only requires the
                        adjustment of the <i>"top of <b>Stack</b>"</i> pointer.<br>

                           with ease.<br><br>
                           
                           If you wished to place the book
                           on a shelf having read the title,
                           it would be highly advantageous to
                           start with the top book and work
                           downwards.<br><br>
                           
                           Taking books from the bottom is not
                           impossible (few things are) just daft.
                           Every book removal would affect all the books
                           in the pile and involves a lot more
                           work.<br><br>

		                      The only time the <b>Order</b> of the <b>Dictionary
		                      Elements</b> is apparent is when they are being

               target="_blank">set</a> definition</hh5m><br><br>

              A <b>Python set</b> is an <b>Unordered Mutable</b>
              collection of <b>Data Objects</b> of any suitable type.<br><br>
              
              Every <b>set</b> element is <b>Unique</b> (no duplicates)
              and must be <b>Immutable</b>.<br><br>
              
              One practical reason that  <b>Elements</b> have
              to be <b>Unique</b> is that set elements
              are referenced by their <b>Value</b>.
              <b>Python</b> could therefore not distinguish between
              two <b>set</b> elements with the same <b>Value</b>.<br><br>

              <b>Elements</b> have to be <b>Immutable</b>, not because of any
              conceptual consideration, but because
              it is more efficient if this
              restriction is applied.<br><br>
              
              To expand slightly, <b>Python</b> uses a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"
               target="_blank">hash code</a> determined by an
              element's <b>Value</b> to reference that element.<br><br>
              
              This would be immensely clumsy if that <b>Value</b> was
              allowed to be altered at any moment (the hash code
              would have to be continually updated).<br><br>
              
              Accordingly, <b>Python dictates</b> that,
              <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27113676/why-is-it-not-possible-to-have-a-set-as-an-element-of-a-set"
	              target="_blank">in general, all mutable
			           types are not <b>hashable</b></a> (that is,
			           all <b>hashable</b> objects are <b>Immutable</b>.<br><br>
			           
			           In particular, <b>Python dictates</b>
			           that all <b>set</b> elements are <b>Immutable</b>.<br><br>
              
              In addition, <b>Immutable</b> objects
              are more memory efficient.<br><br>
              
              A Python <b>set</b> has the form:<br><br>

              &emsp;<i>{&lt;set item&gt;, &lt;set item&gt;,
              &lt;set item&gt;, &lt;set item&gt;, ... }</i><br><br>

	             The number of &lt;set item&gt; elements
	             can vary between <b>0</b> and <b>Lots</b>.<br><br>

              An <b>Empty Dictionary</b>, following
              convention, would be represented thus:<br><br>

              &emsp;<b>{}</b><br><br>

              However, <b>{}</b> has already been
              designated to represent an <b>Empty
              dict</b>! So the only way to reference
              the <b>Empty set</b> is:<br><br>

              &emsp;&emsp;<b>set()</b><br><br>
              
              <p class="hint">
                There is also a <b>Data type frozenset</b>,
                which is simple a immutable
                version of a <b>set</b>.<br><br>
                
                So <b>set</b> is to <b>frozenset</b>
                as <b>list</b> is to <b>tuple</b>.<br><br>
                
                The main justification of
                <b>frozensets</b> is to allow <b>sets</b> to
                include <b>set Elements</b>.<br><br>
                
                <b>Python</b> will not allow a normal <b>set</b> to
                include a <b>set</b> as <b>sets</b> are mutable
                (and so not hashable in <b>Python</b>).<br><br>
                
                However, a <b>set <i>MAY</i></b> include a <b>frozenset</b>,
                as it is immutable (and so <b>Python</b> hashable)
                and is in all ways that normally matter,
                the same as a <b>set</b>.<br><br>
                
                That is all I will say about <b>frozensets</b>,
                unless I can think of a neat exercise
                that needs one of course.

              <hh5m> set creation</hh5m><br><br>
              
              Like most <b>Python Data Objects</b>, <b>set Objects</b>
              are commonly create by <b>Simple Assignment</b>, as illustrated
              here:<br><br>
            
              <span class="command">
                >>> Set_Empty=set()<br>
                >>> Set_V_HydroAA={'V','I','L','M','F','W','C','M'}<br>
                >>> print(Set_Empty,Set_V_HydroAA,sep='\n')<br>
                set()<br>
                {'M', 'C', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'W', 'F'}<br>
                >>>  
	             </span><br><br>
	             
	             Note that duplication of <b>Key</b> ('<b>M</b>' in this case) was
	             eliminated.<br><br>
	         
	             Alternatively, <b>sets</b> can be
	             created using the <b>Builtin Function set()</b>.<br><br>
	             
	             How, is explained in the next subsection.<br><br>
                 
              <hh5m> set Builtin Functions</hh5m><br><br>

              As a <b>set</b> certainly has
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality"
               target="_blank"><b>cardinality</b></a>,
              <b>len()</b>, will work. It simply
              returns the number of <b>set Elements</b>
              in the <b>set</b>.<br><br>
              
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#func-set"
               target="_blank">set()</a> is a
              function to create<b>Python sets</b>.<br><br>
               
              A simplified syntax for <b>set()</b> is:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;<i>set(&lt;iterable&gt;)</i><br><br>
              
              There can be <b>one</b> <i>&lt;iterable&gt;</i> or <b>none</b>.
              As has already been seen, if set is given no <b>Argument</b>,
              it returns an <b>Empty set</b>.<br><br>
              
              If an <b>Argument</b> is provided, the <b>Data types</b>
              that would be accepted (<b>iterables</b>)
              would include <b>list</b>, <b>tuple</b>,
              <b>range</b>, <b>dict</b> or <b>set</b>.<br><br>
              
              It would seem a little perverse to use
              a <b>set</b> to create a <b>set</b>?
              One would only achieve
              a copy of the original which
              can be done more
              sensibly with <b>set.copy()</b>
              (see <b>methods</b> below).
              However, here we discuss the
              possible without
              questioning the sanity.<br><br>

                      <div class="answer"><br>
                        Well, I wanted to say:<br><br>
                        
                        <i>"No! a <b>set</b>
                        cannot be <b>iterable</b> because
                        its elements are not <b>ordered</b>!<br><br>
                        
                        There can be no concept '<b>next</b>'
                        unless there is <b>order</b>"</i>.<br><br>
                        
                        However, a <b>set <i>is</i></b> demonstrably
                        <b>iterable</b>?<br><br>
                        
                        <span class="command">

                        The <b>Builtin Function set()</b> appears to sort
                        the <b>list</b> from which it makes the <b>set</b>?
                        Possibly because this
                        simplifies the detection and elimination of duplicate
                        elements (<b>5</b> in this case)?<br><br>
                        
                        It also
                        demonstrates that the
                        <b>list</b> order is not relevant to the set.<br><br>
                        
                        The <b>set</b> must have an order,but not one that
                        is specified or guaranteed by <b>Python</b>.
                        The claim of <b>Python</b> that <b>sets</b> are
                        "<b>Unordered</b>" might possible be restated
                        (more accurately?) as <i>"<b>sets</b>
                        are ordered unpredictably"</i>.<br><br>
                        
                        Maybe the argument would be, "if an
                        "<b>Unordered</b>" set can be easily be made
                        <b>iterable</b>,
                        why not do it?"<br><br> if it can be
                        useful and the order of delivery of
                        <b>next()</b> is not important.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Unordered</b> or <b>Unpredictably Ordered</b>,
                        either way, access by positional <b>Index</b>
                        (and/or <b>Slicing</b>), whilst possible, makes
                        absolutely no sense at all and is not
                        allowed by <b>Python</b>.<br><br>

		        It is possible, and indeed common,
		        to expand the <b>Core Python</b> functionality by
		        the inclusion of <b>Libraries</b> of additional
		        <b>Routines</b>, <b>Data Objects</b>,
		        <b>Data Classes</b> etc.<br><br>
		        
		        In this way, the <b>Core Language</b> is not obliged to
		        provide functionality to meet the requirements of
		        any and every project
		        to which a user might aspire.
		        Such an attempt would result
		        in a very ugly, bloated <b>Language</b>
		        with huge redundancies.<br><br>
		        
		        Instead the <b>core Language</b> offers the
		        essentials and the user must
		        "<b>import</b>" <b>Libraries</b> to meet any

				        <b><u>Terminology Pause:</u></b><br><br>
				        
				        There is a variety of terms used to refer
				        to the collections of extra <b>Language
				        Elements</b> that can be imported into a
				        program. For <b>Python</b> the most important
				        are "<b>Module</b>" and <b>Package</b>".
				        
				        An informative overview of
				        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19198166/whats-the-difference-between-a-module-and-a-library-in-python"
				         target="_blank">several
				        relevant terms and concepts can be found here</a>.
				        I summarise and slightly modify thus:<br><br>
				        
				        <ul>
				          <li>
				            A <b>Module</b> is, generally, a file containing
				            <b>Python</b> definitions and statements.
				            The file name is the <b>module</b> name
				            with the suffix "<b>.py</b>" appended.<br><br>
				            
				            I say "generally" as there are
				            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18857355/where-are-math-py-and-sys-py"
				             target="_blank">exceptions</a>.
				            For example, some very commonly
				            used modules such as "<b>math</b>"
				            (a <b>Library</b> of standard Mathematical
				            Functions, Constants and similar)
				            is written in <b>C</b> and directly
				            incorporated into the </b>Python Interpreter</b>.
				            This is done for reasons of efficiency.
				            The <b>math</b> module (and others like it) must
				            still be explicitly "<b>imported</b>" before
				            its functionality can be accessed.
				          </li><br>
				          
				          <li>
				            A <b>Package</b> is a hierarchy of <b>Modules</b>
				            and <b>Packages</b> arranged
				            in <b>Directories</b>.<br><br>
				            
				            Typically, a <b>Package</b> is a collection
				            of <b>Modules</b> in a single <b>Directory</b>, but
				            the possibility for a <b>Package</b> to include
				            a <b>Sub Package(s)</b> (involving
				            <b>Sub Directories</b>) does exist.
				          </li><br>
				          
				          <li>
				            A <b>Library</b> is a generic term
				            which includes both <b>Modules</b>
				            and <b>Packages</b>.<br><br>
				            
				            Often, the term <b>Library</b> is
				            used to refer to a published
				            collection of <b>Modules</b>, <b>Packages</b> and similar.
				          </li>

		        <b>Data Classes</b>, <b>Data Structures</b> etc.
		        that have been described so far in this tutorial.
		        All these are available from the <b>Python
		        Interpreter</b> by default (<b>The Core of Python</b>).<br><br>
		         
		        The bulk of the <b>Python Standard Library</b>,
		        however, is comprised of <b>Modules</b>
		        and <b>Packages</b>
		        that have to be explicitly requested
		        (or "<b>imported</b>" as <b>Python</b> prefers) before their
		        functionality is available to a program.<br><br>
		        
		        These <b>Modules</b> and <b>Packages</b>
		        exist in your computer
		        as files (with a "<b>.py</b>" extension) and
		        <b>Directories</b> (for the <b>Packages</b>).
		        Take a look, they are normally in a directory
		        called something like <b>/usr/lib/python3.7</b>
		        (for <b>linux</b>, goodness knows
		        where <b>Windows</b> might hide them!).<br><br>
		        
		        <img class="centimg" src="Images/py_module.png"
				           alt="Fiddle!" height="193" width="305"><br>
				           
				      Each <b>Directory</b> comprises a <b>Package</b>.
				      Each "<b>.py</b>" <b>File</b> is a <b>Module</b>.
				      Note the lack of a <b>Directory</b> called
				      "<b>math</b>" or a <b>File</b> called "<b>math.py</b>".<br><br>
				      
				      <img class="centimg" src="Images/py_package.png"
				           alt="Fiddle!" height="117" width="318"><br>
				           
				      Inside the <b>Directory urllib</b> are the <b>Module
				      Files</b> for the constituents of the
				      <b>urllib Package</b>.<br><br>
				      
				      A <b>Package</b> (such as <b>urllib</b>)
				      can be "<b>imported</b>" as
				      a whole or it is possible to "<b>import</b>"
				      individual elements of a <b>Package</b>.
				      <b>Individual Package Elements</b> must be
				      referenced by prepending their names with
				      the <b>Package</b> name followed by a <b>Full Stop</b>.
				      This so the <b>Package Element</b> can be
				      located by the <b>Python interpreter</b>. For
				      example, the <b>Modules</b> of the
				      <b>urllib Package</b> would be imported individually as:<br><br>
				      
				      &emsp;&emsp;<b>urllib.error<br>
				      &emsp;&emsp;urllib.parse<br>
		        &emsp;&emsp;urllib.request<br>
		        &emsp;&emsp;urllib.response<br>
		        &emsp;&emsp;urllib.robotparser</b><br><br>
		        
		        The <b>Interpreter</b> does not need the
		        "<b>.py</b>" extension to find the <b>Module</b>.<br><br>
		
		        The <b>Modules</b> and <b>Packages</b>
		        available from the <b>Python Standard Library</b> are many.
		        As you will see if you take a quick glance at the 
		        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/py-modindex.html"

      <h2><u>SYNTAX for Importing Modules/Packages</u></h2>
      
      <div>
		      The <b>Python Keyword</b> used to <b>Import Modules</b> and/or
		      <b>Packages</b> into a <b>Python</b> program is,
		      unsurprisingly, 
		      <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list#from_import"
		       target="_blank">"<b>import</b>"</a>.<br><br>
		      
		      Used in its most simple form, the <b>Syntax</b> is just:<br><br>
		      
		      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>import</b> <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i><br><br>
		      
		      Before the import statement, all the wonders of <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i> are denied the Python program.
		      
		      After the import, the splendours of <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i> are available in their entirety!<br><br>
		      
		      Two obvious questions have just thrust themselves upon your conscious. To whit:<br><br>
		      
		      <ul>
		        <li>
		          <b><u>Question:</u></b> "But how does
		          one know what functionallity <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i>
		          has to offer?"<br><br>
		        
		          <b><u>Answer:</u></b> Use the 
		          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#dir"
		           target="_blank"><b>Builtin Function dir()</b></a>
		          and all will be revealed. That is, type:<br><br>
		          
		          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>dir(</b><i>&lt;Library&gt;</i><b>)</b>
		          
		        </li><br>
		        <li>
		          <b><u>Question:</u></b> "What if two <b>Libraries</b>, or a
		          <b>Library</b> and <b>Core Python</b> have a name clash?"<br><br>
		          
		          <b><u>Answer:</u></b> Items from a
		          <b>Library</b>,
		          if imported as shown above, must
		          have their names
		          prefixed by the name of the
		          <b>Library</b> followed by a
		          <b>Full Stop</b>. So, a <b>function</b>
		          called <b>fiddle</b>, from a
		          <b>Library</b> called <b>diddle</b>
		          would be invoked thus:<br><br>
		          
		          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>diddle.fiddle()</b><br><br>
		          
		          distinguishing it from a <b>function</b>
		          called <b>fiddle</b>, of a
		          <b>Library</b> called <b>middle</b> which would be invoked thus:<br><br>
		          
		          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>middle.fiddle()</b><br><br>
		          
		          Of course a <b>function</b> called <b>fiddle</b> which was
		          <b>Builtin</b> to <b>Python</b> would be invoked simply thus:<br><br>
		          
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>fiddle()</b><br><br>
			          
			         In this way, all name clash problem fade away
			         e'en more swiftly and sweetly than the dew
			         of a summer morn.<br><br>
		        </li>

										    		Amongst the elements

										    		shown to be a <b>float</b>, set
										    		to twice the value of <b>Pi</b>.<br><br>
										    		
										    		Somewhat illogically, an attempt
										    	 to alter the value of

										    	 This worked! and <b>random.TWOPI</b> was
										    	 mutated into an <b>int</b>, set to <b>47</b>.<br><br>
										    	 
										    	 Logically, <b>random.TWOPI</b> should

		        <li>
		          Following on directly from
		          the previous exercise, assume
		          there was a good reason to change
		          the values of some elements
		          (specifically <b>TWOPI</b>) of <b>random</b>
		          for some particular purpose.<br><br>
		          
		          Consider how you might return
		          the entire <b>random module</b>
		          to its original state after
		          that purpose has been achieved.<br><br>
		          
		          You could assign the original
		          values to all the elements you altered individually?
		          This would not always be possible,
		          for example, if you had changed
		          a <b>Function</b> into an <b>int</b>!!<br><br>
		          
		          <span class="command">
														>>> type(random.randint)<br>
														&lt;class 'method'&gt;<br>
														>>> random.randint=47<br>
														>>> type(random.randint)<br>
														&lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
														>>> 
												</span><br><br>
												
												Even reinstating <b>TWOPI</b> would
											 not be trivial due to precision issues.<br><br>
											 
											 So, you need to refresh the
											 whole <b>module</b> somehow.<br><br>
											 
											 Maybe just <b>import</b> it again?
											 Try it. Did it work?<br><br>

																The ghastly truth is
															 that <b>importlib.reload()</b>
															 only works on external <b>Libraries</b>.
															 I will not refresh <b>Builtin Libraries</b>
															 such as <b>math</b>.<br><br>
															 
															 I feel sure you noticed this amongst
															 the many exceptions and caveats
															 listed in the manual entry for
															 <b>importlib.reload()</b><br><br>
															 
															 The <b><i>ONLY</i></b> way
															 to reload a <b>Builtin
															 Library</b> that has been corrupted is
															 to restart the <b>Python Interpreter</b>!
															 Tedious in interactive mode,
															 impossible otherwise.<br><br>
															 
															 Well we seem to have spent a long
															 time climbing to what I would now
															 summarise with one <b>Rule</b> and one
															 <b>Reflection</b>. To whit:<br><br>
															 
															 <ul>
															   <li>
																			 <b>Rule:</b> Never edit anything
																			 loaded from a <b>module</b>, even if you can.
																			 It rarely, if ever, makes sense and
																			 changes are difficult if
																			 not impossible to reverse.
																		</li><br>
																		<li>															 
																			 <b>Reflection:</b> It is a pity
																			 <b>Python</b> allows one to do stupid
																			 things like change the value of <b>Pi</b>.
																			 But so be it.
																		</li>
																</ul><br>
																
																In the course of this quest, of rather
															 flat conclusion, we did get lots of practice
															 importing things, so I will leave it in
															 place (until I think of something better at least).<br><br>
															 
															 If not every detail was clear, it is not
															 so important, as long as you understand
															 a bit about <b>Modules</b> and <b>Packages</b> and,
															 just how perverse the world programming can be!<br><br>

				  When <b>Libraries</b> have longer names,
				  prefixing each <b>module element</b> with the <b>module
				  name</b> and a <b>Full Stop</b> can be clumsy.<br><br>
				  
				  You can improve matters using the <b>Keyword as</b>
				  in a marginally extended <b>Syntax</b> for
				  <b>import</b> thus:<br><br>
				  
				  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>import</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i> <b>as</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library_Alias&gt;</i><br><br>
				  
				  If loaded in this fashion, an element of <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i>
				  can only be accessed by prefixing the element
				  name with <i>&lt;Library_Alias&gt;</i>
				  followed by a <b>Full Stop</b>.<br><br>
				  
				  Prefixing with <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i>
				  followed by a <b>Full Stop</b> is no longer even an option.<br><br>
				  
				  Try it:<br><br>
				  
				  <span class="command">
				    >>> import math as m<br>
								>>> math.pi<br>
								Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br>
								NameError: name 'math' is not defined<br>
								>>> m.pi<br>
								3.141592653589793<br>
								>>> 
						</span><br><br>
						
						A further expansion of the <b>import Syntax</b> introduces
					 the <b>Keyword from</b>, as follows:<br><br>
						
				  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i> <b>import</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library_Element&gt;</i><br><br>
				  
				  This <b>Syntax</b> allows the
				  <b>import</b> of a single <b>Element</b> of a
				  <b>module</b> in such a fashion it can
				  be access with no prefix to its name.<br><br>
				  
				  For example:<br><br>
				  
				  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from math import pi</b><br><br>
				  
				  Try it:<br><br>
				  
      <span class="command">
        >>> from math import pi<br>
								>>> pi<br>
								3.141592653589793<br>
								>>>
      </span><br><br>
      
      There could be problems with name
      clashes here of course.
      Caution is advised.<br><br>
      
      Potential name clash issues could be
      minimised by renaming the <b>imported
      Library Element</b> with the
      <b>Keyword as</b>.<br><br>
      
  			 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library&gt;</i> <b>import</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library_Element&gt;</i>
				  <b>as</b>
				  <i>&lt;Library_Element_Alias&gt;</i><br><br>
				  
				  For example:<br><br>
				  
				  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from math import pi as Pi</b><br><br>
				  
      <span class="command">
        >>> from math import Pi<br>
								>>> Pi<br>
								3.141592653589793<br>
								>>>
      </span><br><br>
      
      Finally, for the truly bold, one can
      <b>import</b> all the elements of a <b>Library</b> at
      once by using the wildcard '<b>*</b>' thus:<br><br>
      
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from math import *</b><br><br>
      
      After this command, every element of the <b>module math</b> can be
      accessed without any prefix. Fine, as long as there are no name clashes.
      <a href="https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/maintainability/from_module_import_all_used.html"
       target="_blank">This approach is not recommended</a>, unless you are absolutely
      certain its consequences will be exactly as you intended.<br><br>
      
      Maybe to <b>import</b> a <b>module</b> you have written
      yourself (covered later) with a very particular <b>Name Space</b>?<br><br>
      
      But, for example, there are a number of
      <b>Mathematically Orientated Libraries</b>
      you might well want to use in parallel
      that have copious name duplications.<br><br>

		         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>pow(3,9)</b><br><br>
		         
		         are you using the <b>Builtin Version</b> of
		         <b>pow()</b>, or the version from the <b>module math</b>?<br><br>
		         
		         <div class="hint">
		           There is more than one way to discover
		           the answer to this question.<br><br>
		           
		           For the most elegant approach it
		           would help to remember that, just like any other
		           <b>Python Data Objects</b>, <b>module methods</b>
		           can be compared using "<b>is</b>" and
		           "<b>is not</b>".<br>

								        <span class="command">
																		>>> from math import pow<br>
																		>>> <br>
																		>>> pow is math.pow<br>
																		True<br>
																		>>>
																</span><br><br>
																
																Remember, first you imported the whole
															 <b>Builtin math module</b> using:<br><br>
																
																&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>import math</b><br><br>
																
																This would have installed all the
															 elements of <b>math</b> and made them available
															 as long as elements names are prefixed
															 with "<b>math.</b>".<br><br>
																
																Then you <b>imported <i>just</i></b> the <b>math
															 method pow()</b> in a fashion that allowed
															 its access without the "<b>math.</b>" prefix.<br><br>
																
																Recall that you cannot <b>import</b> a <b>module</b>
															 twice, so the <b>math method pow()</b> already
															 loaded, will not have been overwritten.
															 However, the evidence is that a new
															 <b>Reference</b> to <b>math.pow()</b> has been created
															 and has <b><i>overwritten</i></b> the <b>Reference</b>
															 to the <b>Builtin</b> version of <b>pow()</b>.<br><br>
															 
															 The destruction of the only <b>Reference</b> to
															 the <b>Builtin version of pow()</b> does not feel
															 too comfortable to me?<br><br>
															 
															 There is no way to reinstate it short
															 of restarting the <b>Python Interpreter</b>.<br><br>
															 
															 Maybe one should consider a little more
															 carefully when facing potential name clashes
															 between <b>modules</b> and <b>Core Python</b>? After all,
															 the <b>import Syntax</b> does make very simple
															 provision for a less cavalier approach.<br><br>
															 
															 Instead of:<br><br>
															 
															 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from math import pow</b><br><br>
															 
															 why not:<br><br>
															 
															 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>from math import pow as m_pow</b><br><br>
															 
															 Not so slick, but far safer.<br><br>
															 
								        <span class="command">
																	 >>> import math<br>
																		>>> from math import pow as m_pow<br>
																		>>> pow(3,4,2)<br>
																		1<br>
																		>>> math.pow(3,4)<br>
																		81.0<br>
																		>>> m_pow(3,4)<br>
																		81.0<br>
																		>>> m_pow is math.pow<br>
																		True<br>
																		>>>
																</span><br><br>
																
																Well, suit yourself really, I just attempt
															 to point out the pitfalls. If you are sure that
															 name clashes are not an issue,
															 there cannot be a problem.<br><br>
															 
															 My preference would be just to <b>import</b> the
															 whole <b>module</b> with as short a name as
															 possible. That is:<br><br>
															 
															 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>import math as m</b><br><br>
															 
															 simple, slightly less to type, and safe.<br><br>			

																An alternative method of answering the question of this exercise would be to run <b>pow()</b>
															 with a third argument. The fact
															 that <b>pow()</b>
															 would complain would indicate that you were
															 using the <b>math</b> version
															 of the function which does
															 not accept a third argument.
															 This works, but is very ugly!!<br><br>
															 
								        <span class="command">
																		>>> pow(2,3,4)<br>
																		Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
																		&nbsp;&nbsp;File "&lt;stdin&gt:", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br>
																		TypeError: pow() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)<br>
																		>>> 
																</span><br><br>
																
															 Of course, you could make this option
															 more acceptable if you used
															 the <b>try</b> and <b>except Keywords</b>
															 (discussed previously) thus:<br><br>
															 
								        <span class="command">
								          >>> try:<br>
																		... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pow(2,3,4)<br>
																		... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Sucess! Implying the Builtin pow()")<br>
																		... except TypeError:<br>
																		... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Failure! Implying the math pow()")<br>
																		... <br>
																		Failure! Implying the math pow()<br>
																		>>>

        <h2>Preparing to write Python Programs</h2>
        
        <div>
		        <div class="hint">
		          For this section of the tutorial,
		          I will assume your <b>Operating System</b> is
		          very similar to mine and that you have
		          gone through the <b>Unix Introduction</b>
		          suggested at the very start.
		        </div><br>
		        
		        Up to this point, we have primarily been
		        considering the elements of <b>Python</b>.
		        Particularly their <b>Syntax</b>, but hopefully
		        a little more than that wherever possible.<br><br>
		        
		        To do this, using the <b>Python Interpreter
		        Interactively</b> seemed the best vehicle.<br><br>
		        
		        From this point we will look at
		        the <b>Structures Python</b> provides
		        to assemble useful programs from
		        these building blocks.<br><br>
		        
		        This is best achieved by preparing
		        code in text files to be
		        run by the <b>Python Interpreter</b>,
		        <b>Non-Interactively</b>,
		        from the <b>Command Line</b>.<br><br>
		        
		        It is rare to get a program
		        (or anything else, come to think of it!) perfectly
		        correct at the first attempt.<br><br>
		        
		        Achieving the goal of a working program generally
		        requires many iterations of
		        <b>Edit &rarr; Test &rarr; Edit</b> ... etc. etc.<br><br>
		        
		        This requires that a suitable <b>Text
		        Editor</b> and a <b>Command Line
		        Terminal</b> (in which to instruct
		        the <b>Interpreter</b>
		        to do its job) be set up to work in a co-ordinated
		        fashion.<br><br>
		        
		        Diagrammatically, something like this:<br><br>

            <div class="minsect"><br>
								      In order to make the development
								      cycle described above conveniently
								      possibility, you need to have a
								      reasonably friendly text editor and
								      a <b>Terminal</b> simultaneously
								      accessible on your screen.<br><br>
								      
								      Both must be focused on the
								      <b>Directory</b> in which you intend to
								      make your programs.<br><br>
								      
								      Any graphical editor, preferably
								      with some capacity to recognise
								      <b>Python Code</b>, will suffice.<br><br>
								      
								      For my computer (<b>Ubuntu</b>), I
								      choose to work in a Directory
								      called <b>Python3</b> which I made
								      in my <b>Desktop</b>.<br><br>
								      
								      I elected to use the <b>Editor
								      gedit</b> (because it will be there,
								      and it does the job).<br><br>
								
								      So to set up, I:<br><br>
								      
								      <ul>
								        <li>
								          Made a new <b>Terminal</b> (<b>Ctrl-Alt-T</b>)
								        </li><br>
								        <li>
								          Made my <b>Working Directory</b>
								        </li><br>
								        <li>
								          Moved into that <b>Directory</b>
								        </li><br>
								        <li>
								          Started up <b>gedit</b>
								        </li><br>
								        <li>
								          Shared my screen equally
								          between the editor and the <b>Terminal</b>
								        </li>
								      </ul><br>
								      
								      As you went through my magnificent <b>UNIX
								      tutorial</b> earlier, you will follow how
								      I did this.<br><br>
								      
								      Do the same, or, whatever creates a
								      similar environment on your machine.<br><br>
								
								      Hopefully, your screen looks something
								      like this:<br><br>
								      
								    		<img src="Images/Workspace.png"
								           alt="Fiddle!"
								           class="centimg"
								           style="background: White;
								                  border-style: solid;
								                  border-color: red;
								                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
								
								      If you are using <b>gedit</b>, let it know you are
								      writing <b>Python Code</b> (<b>View &rarr;
								      Highlight Mode... &rarr; Python 3</b>).<br><br>
								      
								      And so now ... a simple program to
								      test the system?<br><br>
								      
								      I really was quite desperate to
								      avoid including
								      this ubiquitous nonsense example
								      in this tutorial!
								      OK OK, I admit defeat gracelessly.<br><br>
								      
								      Type into <b>gedit</b>:<br><br>
								      
								      <span class="code">
								        print("Hello Flipping World!")<br>
								        print("This is my very first
								        miserable program!!")<br>
								        print("and the last time I allow my
								        computer to patronize me!!!")
								      </span><br><br>
								      
								      Save this nonsense in a file
								      called "<b>Hello.py</b>"<br><br>
								      
								      Move across to your <b>Terminal</b>
								      window and run your new and exciting
								      program by typing:<br><br>
								      
								      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>python Hello.py</b><br><br>
								      
								    		<img src="Images/Hello01.png"
								           alt="Fiddle!"
								           class="centimg"
								           style="background: White;
								                  border-style: solid;
								                  border-color: red;
								                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
								                  
								      The command:<br><br>
								      
								      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>python</b><br><br>
								      
								      (or similar, depending upon your system)
								      without any <b>Argument</b>, invokes the
								      <b>Python Interpreter</b> in <b>Interactive</b>
								      mode, as you have seen.<br><br>
								      
								      Following the command with the
								      name of a file, as you did above,
								      instructs the <b>Python Interpreter</b>
								      to start up and attempt to
								      interpret the contents of the
								      file as <b>Python code</b>.<br><br>
								      
								      If interpretation succeeds,
								      the <b>Interpreter</b> will execute
								      the instructions it has found.<br><br>
								      
								      If interpretation fails, the
								      <b>Interpreter</b> will gush forth
								      explanations for the failure
								      that, typically, require
								      divine intervention and/or
								      the awesome insights of
								      <b>Google</b> to deliver understanding
								      to the man/woman fresh from his/her
								      journey upon the
								      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus"
								       target="_blank">Clapham Omnibus</a>.<br><br>
								      
								      This is not the only way to run
								      <b>Python Programs</b>, but it is the most
								      convenient for the development
								      stages of a program and is entirely
								      sufficient for all the needs of
								      this tutorial.<br><br>
								      
								      For completeness, I will describe
								      how you might set up a fully
								      developed and testing program for
								      production use, in the next section.<br><br>
								      
								      Feel free to skip for now if
								      you wish. You only need to know
								      that bit when you have a program
								      ready for exposure to your ever
								      eager colleagues.

              <hh4>Setting up Python programs for production use</hh4>
            </span>
          </summary>

            <div class="minsect"><br>
              Running <b>Python Programs</b> by explicitly
              invoking the <b>Interpreter</b>, with the
              file containing the <b>Python code</b>
              as an <b>Argument</b>, is fine for the
              code development stages.<br><br>
              
              It is clumsy however, especially
              when you consider that the full
              path to the code file must be
              provided. The file is likely
              to be in the "<b>Current Directory</b>"
              during development, but for
              production use, it would be foolish
              to expect users to make local
              copies of all the programs they
              might want to use!<br><br>
              
              Should a user be bored and/or
              insane enough to want to run
              your <b>Hello.py</b> program. He/She
              would expect just to have to type:<br><br>
              
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Hello</b><br><br>
              
              to sate his/her astoundingly
              limited drive for thrill and
              excitement.<br><br>
              
              This goal can be simply achieved
              in three steps.<br><br>
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Add a line at the very top of the
                  <b>Python Code File</b> that informs the
                  <b>Operating System</b> how to <b>Execute</b>
                  this <b>File</b> as a <b>Program</b>.<br><br>
                  
                  This is a simple line that only
                  has to record where to find the
                  <b>Python Interpreter</b>.<br><br>
                  
                  So, where is the
                  <b>Python Interpreter</b>??????<br><br>
                  
                  <b>Linux</b> will tell you if you type:<br><br>
                  
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>which python</b><br><br>
                  
                  in a <b>Terminal Window</b>. This command and reads as:<br><br>
                  
                  <i>"If I type <b>python</b>, <b>which</b> program will you execute?"</i><br><br>
                  
												    		<img src="Images/which_python.png"
												           alt="Fiddle!"
												           class="centimg"
												           style="background: White;
												                  border-style: solid;
												                  border-color: red;
												                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
								                                    
                  As you see, the answer is usually (but not always):<br><br>
                  
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>/usr/bin/python</b><br><br>
                  
                  In front of this address, you must put a '<b>#</b>', to
                  ensure that the <b>Python Interpreter</b> does
                  not try to make sense of this line
                  (remember that anything following a '<b>#</b>'
                  is comment as far as the <b>Interpreter</b>
                  is concerned).<br><br>
                  
                  Between the '<b>#</b>' and the
                  address you need a '<b>!</b>',
                  which informs the <b>Operating
                  System</b> that it <b><i>must</b></i> interpret
                  this line.<br><br>
                  
                  So the extra line for you <b>Code File</b>
                  is therefore:<br><br>
                  
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>#!/usr/bin/python</b><br><br>
                  
                  Add it to your <b>Hello.py</b>
                  file and save. You should now have:<br><br>
                  
			 								      <span class="code">
												        #!/usr/bin/python<br><br>
												        
												        print("Hello Flipping World!")<br>
												        print("This is my very first
												        miserable program!!")<br>
												        print("and the last time I allow my
												        computer to patronize me!!!")
												      </span>
												    </li><br>
												    <li>
	                 Next, you need to upgrade
	                 your <b>Code File</b> from just a
	                 simple <b>Text File</b> to a
	                 <b>Program File</b> that can be <b>Executed</b>.<br><br>
	                 
	                 Trying to execute <b>Hello.py</b> as
	                 it is will fail because it is
	                 not regarded as executable by
	                 the <b>Operating System</b>.<br><br>
	                 
	                 You need "to <b>ch</b>ange" the <b>mod</b>e
	                 of the file by awarding
	                 "Permission to e<b>x</b>ecute" to at
	                 least the file's owner (you).<br><br>
	                 
	                 The command to award e<b>x</b>ecute
	                 permission to <b>a</b>ll is:<br><br>
	                 
	                 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>chmod a+x Hello.py</b><br><br>
	                 
	                 More decoratively:<br>
	                 
	                 <img src="Images/chmod.png"
												           alt="Fiddle!"
												           class="centimg"
												           style="background: White;
												                  border-style: solid;
												                  border-color: red;
												                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
												                  
												      At this stage, it should be possible to
												      run the code in <b>Hello.py</b> with the
												      command:<br><br>
												      
												      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>./Hello.py</b><br><br>
												      
												      The "<b>./</b>" in front of the "<b>Hello.py</b>" is
												      required to tell the <b>Operating System</b>
												      where the <b>Code File</b> is. As you remember
												      clearly from my awesome <b>UNIX Tutorial</b>,
												      "<b>.</b>" refers to the current directory.<br><br>
												      
												      Try it:<br>
												      
												    		<img src="Images/chmod_Hello.png"
												           alt="Fiddle!"
												           class="centimg"
												           style="background: White;
												                  border-style: solid;
												                  border-color: red;
												                  border-width: 2px;">
								        </li><br>
								        <li>
								          Finally, it is required to find
								          some way to avoid
								          including the full path of the <b>Code
								          File</b> in the <b>Hello</b> command.<br><br>
								          
								          When a command is issued, a set of
								          directories are searched, in turn,
								          for a program that matches the command.<br><br>
								          
								          If no match is found, and error message is issued.<br><br>
								          
								          <img src="Images/hello_missing.png"
												           alt="Fiddle!"
												           class="centimg"
												           style="background: White;
												                  border-style: solid;
												                  border-color: red;
												                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
												                  
												      The ordered set of directories that are
												      recorded by the <b>Systems Variable</b>
												      called <b>PATH</b>.<br><br>
												      
												      The contents of <b>PATH</b> can be
												      viewed using the command:<br><br>
												      
												      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>echo $PATH</b><br><br>
												      
												      "<b>$PATH</b>" meaning <i>"The <b>Value</b>
												      of the <b>Variable</b> called
												      <b>PATH</b>"</i>.<br><br>
												      
												      The simplest way to make a program
												      accessible to all users of a
												      given system would be to copy it to
												      one of the directories listed.<br><br>
												      
												      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>/usr/local/bin</b><br><br>
												      
												      generally exists for that very purpose.<br><br>
												      
												      Or, you could extend the list of directories
												      using the following commands:<br><br>
												      
												      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>PATH=$PATH:/home/dpjudge/Desktop/Python3</b><br>
												      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>export PATH</b><br><br>
												      
												      The first command reads:<br><br>
												      
												      <i>"Make the <b>Value</b> of <b>PATH</b> be its
												      current <b>Value</b> (<b>$PATH</b>) appended
												      by <b>:/home/dpjudge/Desktop/Python3</b>"</i><br><br>
												      
												      The "<b>export</b>" command makes
												      the new value of <b>PATH</b> active
												      ("<b>exports</b>"it).<br><br>
												      
												      Outside of the context of this tutorial,
												      this is not a good solution. Amongst other
												      objections, it only works for the current
												      user (you), and the current session.<br><br>
												      
												      But it does work:<br><br>
								
												    		<img src="Images/PATH.png"
												           alt="Fiddle!"
												           class="centimg"
												           style="background: White;
												                  border-style: solid;
												                  border-color: red;
												                  border-width: 2px;"><br>
												      
												      Finally, you need to lose the requirement
												      to included the "<b>.py</b>" file
												      extension in the command.<br><br>
												      
												      There are lots of ways to do this, including:<br>
												      
												      <ul>
												        <li>
												          an alias
												        </li>
											         <li>
												          a soft link
												        </li>
											         <li>
												        		rename the Code File
												        </li>
											         <li>
												          copy the Code File
												        </li>
												      </ul><br>
												      
														    Of which I think the last is the tidiest.<br><br>
										          
												    		<img src="Images/Hello_found.png"

        <h2>Conditional Code Block Execution</h2>
        
        <div>
	         In the next three tutorial sections we will
	         how the coding elements introduced
	         above can be arranged into a
	         coherently structured program.<br><br>
	         
	         First, the simple idea of making the
	         execution of blocks of code depend upon
	         evaluation of some <b>Condition(s)</b>.<br><br>
	         
	         Or ... more crudely ... only executing
	         certain blocks of instructions if some
	         <b>Conditional Expression</b> is <b>True</b>.<br><br>
	         
	         <b><u>Pseudo-Code</u></b><br>
	         <div class="pseudo">
	           
			         Do some interesting things<br><br>
			         
			         Only if conditions are favourable:<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do some more interesting things<br><br>
			         
			         Carrying on doing yet more interesting things<br><br>
	         </div><br>
	         
	         Cleverer still!! being enabling a
	         choice between two blocks of code,
	         one to be executed if a <b>Condition</b> be
	         <b>True</b>, the other if the <b>Conditional
	         Value</b> is <b>False</b>.<br><br>
	         
	         <b><u>Pseudo-Code</u></b><br>
	         <div class="pseudo">
			         Do interesting things<br><br>
			         
			         if conditions are favourable:<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do celebratory things<br>
			         Otherwise, as conditions are not favourable:<br>
	           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do more cautious things<br><br>
	           
			         Carrying on doing further things of
			         unconditional interest<br><br>
	         </div><br>
	         
	         Ultimately, choose one of several courses of action,
	         dependent upon a number of mutually exclusive conditions:<br><br>
	         
	         <b><u>Pseudo-Code</u></b><br>
	         <div class="pseudo">
	         
			         Do interesting things<br><br>
			         
			         if condition <b>A</b> applies:<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do <b>A</b> compatible things<br>
			         if condition <b>B</b> applies:<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do <b>B</b> compatible things<br>
			         if condition <b>C</b> applies:<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do <b>C</b> compatible things<br>
			         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;...<br>
			         Otherwise, as no specified conditions apply:<br>
	           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do some very general things<br><br>
	           
			         Carrying on doing further things of
			         unconditional interest<br><br>
	         </div><br>
	       </div>
      </div><br>

								          <div class="experiment">
										          This example is based upon information found
										          <a href="https://proteinstructures.com/Structure/Structure/amino-acids.html"
										           target="_blank">"<b>here</b>"</a>.<br><br>
										          
										          The <b>module random</b> is used here. <b>random</b>
										          enables the generation of <b>random numbers</b>
										          (specifically <b>Integers</b> in the range <b>0 &rarr; 19</b> here).<br><br>
										          
										          Note the use of the <b>seed() method</b> of the
										          <b>random module</b>. The methods of <b>random</b> (such as
										          <b>randint</b>) do not really generate <b>random numbers</b>
										          at all. They generate <b>pseudo random numbers</b>.
										          That is, they use a formula that generates a
										          <b>deterministic</b> (<b>predictable</b> if you prefer)
										          series of numbers that <b><i>appear</i></b> to be <b>random</b>!<br><br>
										          
										          The trouble is, if you start at the same point in the
										          <b>deterministic series</b>, your <i>"random"</i> numbers will
										          always be the same!<br><br>
										          
										          <b>random.seed()</b>, with an integer <b>Argument</b>, always
										          starts the <b>pseudo number generator</b> at the same
										          point, specified by the <b>Integer Argument</b>. This
										          leads to a very predictable series of <i>"random"</i>
										          numbers, as this experiment using the <b>Python
										          Interactive</b> interactively illustrates.<br><br>

														      This <i>"randomness"</i> with a dash of <i>"determinism"</i>
														      can, on occasion, be useful. So it is claimed
														      in the article I will point you towards in
														      a line or three?<br><br>
														      
														      <b>random.seed()</b>, without an <b>Argument</b>, uses the
														      <b>current time</b> to choose a point in the <b>pseudo
														      random number series</b> at which to start. This
														      is as near to <i>"really"</i> <b>random</b> as one can get
														      and it is the approach taken in this example.<br><br>
														      
														      For marginally more detail, there is a very
														      readable discussion to be found
														      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22639587/random-seed-what-does-it-do"
										           target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
										           
										          <div class="hint">
										            Way back in the times before "<b>The Epoch</b>"
										            (featured in the next example) and
										            similar nonsense, random numbers were
										            read from a book!<br><br>
										            
										            <b>Seeding</b> was done by choosing a random page and then using a pin.<br><br>
										            
										            Totally analogous to the way <b>Python</b> does things, but much more fun.
										          </div><br>
										           
										          The code includes three conditionally
										          executed single statements blocks
										          of code that
										          justifies its place her.
										          However it is an offensively poor program!<br><br>
										          
										          <ol>
										            <li>
										              Three mutually exclusive conditionals?
										              If the conditions of the first are met,
										              one still continues to test for match
										              with the other two?
										            </li><br>
										            <li>
										              In theory, the three conditions tested
										              cover all possibilities. However, I
										              would still be inclined to code for
										              the unexpected (maybe just me?). I would
										              always want a clause that  said:<br><br>
										              
										              <i>"and if anything else is true, let me
										              know, maybe someone has invented a new Integer?!"</i>
										            </li><br>
										            <li>
										              Would you really use conditionals
										              like this at all!
										              
										              Lots of better ways, maybe an extended <b>Dictionary</b>?
										              Or a second
										              <b>Dictionary</b> for the <b>Amino Acid Types</b>? Can you
										              design a better program?
										              
										              Much improved versions of this code are
										              possible when more sophisticated conditional
										              statements have been introduced,
										              as you will see.

                  Speaking as one who was there, we had
								          very fine computers in <b>1969</b> and before! Much
								          bigger than the tiny things you all play around with today!
								          Oh well, some battles are just not worth fighting, <b>January
								          1970</b> it is then.<br><br>
								          
								          In this example there were two conditional
								          <b>Code Blocks</b> that were mutually exclusive and
								          covered all possible conditions.Both were tested.<br><br>
								          
								          Note that the continued lines were not indented
								          as they were when using the <b>Python Interpreter
								          Interactively</b>. Had they been indented, the
								          extra white  space would have been assumed
								          to be part of the code.<br><br>
								          
								          It is generally good practice to avoid making
								          the same computation more than once. I have
								          tried to follow that practice here. Can you
								          see where?<br><br>
								          
								          On my system, a <b>Tab</b> ('<b>\t</b>') fills to the
								          next line position divisible by <b>8</b>. I am not
								          sure how consistent that behaviour might be
								          across different platforms.

                  the second <b>if</b> statement.
                  This is more efficient because you
                  ask only one question instead of two,
                  plus it is much tidier and logical.

								          Actually, this code is far closer to the version
								          two sub sections back, just using "<b>if</b>". The only
								          change was to substitute <b>elif</b> for <b>if</b>.<br><br>
								          
								          This simple change does alter the interpretation
								          of the code however. With <b>elif</b>,
								          conditions are only tested until one is found
								          to be <b>True</b>. The efficiency gain, of course,
								          increases linearly with the number of conditions involved.<br><br>
								          
								          I used the longer printed comments here, now the code

								          I also added the impossible else clause at the

										    Answering a <b>Y/N</b> question is a common requirement.

										    With regard to the current solution, note the following:<br><br>
										    
										    <ul>
										      <li>
										        This code illustrates the way the
										        <b>Keyword</b> "<b>in</b>" can be
										        used with <b>tuples</b> (and
										        <b>lists</b> etc.) as well as <b>Strings</b>.
										      </li><br>
										      <li>
										        The strings of <b>Valid YES</b> and <b>NO</b>
										        responses are entirely upper case.<br><br>
										        
										        It has to be neater to allow mixed
										        case responses by "<b>upper casing</b>"
										        the <b>Response String</b> rather than
										        including every combination of upper
										        and lower case "<b>Valid Answer</b>"
										        in these <b>Strings</b>.
										      </li><br>
										      <li>
										        A <b>list</b> could have been used
										        here instead of a <b>tuple</b>.
										        A <b>tuple</b> was chosen as an
										        immutable data structure
										        was required. As discussed
										        previously, <b>tuples</b>
										        should always be preferred
										        unless mutability is essential.
										      </li><br>
										      <li>
										        The input command might be
										        clearer if split into
										        two statements?<br><br>
										        
										        For exactly the same effect:<br><br>
										        
										        <span class="code">Response =
										        input("Today is a splendid day. Do you agree? ")<br>

                The <b>for ... in</b> structure handles the
                details in the background. The user
                can simply consider the
                <i>&lt;Iterable Object&gt;</i> as a set
                of values to be processed by the
                <b>Code Block</b> controlled by the <b>for
                Loop</b>, one at a time, until the
                set is exhausted.<br><br>
                
                For a bit more formality and detail, try

                The way the <b>in Keyword</b> is
                used in a <b>for Loop</b> is somewhat
                different to that seen previously.<br><br>
                
                The <b>for Loop Syntax</b> reads, informally:<br><br>
                
                <i>"<b><u>for</u></b> each of the elements <b><u>in</u></b> the
                specified <b><u>Iterable Object</u></b>, in turn,
                assign the element to a <b><u>variable</u></b>
                and execute the <b>for loop Code Block</b>"</i>

                      <li>
                        To read the "<b>secret message</b>",
                        <b>Copy/Paste</b>
                        the <b>Code</b> to a file and
                        run it (or if you are feeling
                        lazy, just scroll down a trifle).<br><br>

                        The strategy of the "<b>secret code</b>"
                        was to substitute
                        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/ASCII-Table-wide.svg"
                         target="_blank"><b>ASCII</b> codes</a> for
                        <b>characters</b>.<br><br>

                        To <b>decode</b> was simply case of
                        using the
                        <b>chr() builtin function</b>
                        to convert each
                        code, in turn, to a <b>Character</b>,
                        building
                        up a <b>string object</b> representing the
                        <b>decoded message</b>.<br><br>

                        To <b>encode</b> a message, the <b>ord()
                        builtin function</b> might have been used.
                        <b>ord(c)</b>, where <b>c</b> is a
                        <b>Character</b> (or more
                        <i>"Pythonically"</i>, a
                        <b>str</b> of length <b>1</b>), returns
                        the <b>ASCII code</b>
                        corresponding to <b>c</b>.
                      </li><br>

                      <li>
                        Note the lines defining the <b>Message_Coded tuple</b>.
                        Logically, they are all the same line, broken at
                        arbitrary points to allow readability.
                        
                        <b>backslash</b> ("<b>\</b>") characters
                        were not required in this case as the
                        <b>tuple</b> elements are entirely inside
                        <b>()</b> brackets.<br><br>

                         target="_blank">The <b>Python Style Guidelines</b></a>
                        suggest that enclosing
                        instructions that require more than one
                        line in brackets (of any flavour that
                        makes syntactic sense:
                        <b>()</b>, <b>[]</b>, or <b>{}</b>),
                        is a preferred solution
                        to using <b>backslashes</b>. However,
                        it invites the user to make his/her
                        own choice.<br><br>

                        So, for example:<br><br>

                        &nbsp;<b>a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12</b><br><br>

                        <span Style = "color:Red">will not work ...
                        <b>Error Error</b>!!</span><br><br>

                        &nbsp;<b>a = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12)</b><br><br>

                        will work and is the official <b>Python</b>
                        preferred solution. Enclosing an expression in round
                        brackets, though optional, is sound.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;<b>a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
                        +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12</b><br><br>

                        will also work, for people who like
                        <b>backslashes</b>. I probably use
                        more <b>backslashes</b> than the
                        <b>Python Style Guidelines</b> advises.
                        You must decide you own policy.

                    <li>
                      <b>While Loops</b> are very important
                      and widely used, however, a simple
                      and convincing example
                      to show just the syntax is not easy to invent
                      if just dressing up a <b>For Loop</b> in
                      ill-fitting apparel is to be avoided!<br><br>

                      A <b>For Loop</b> can just count through a
                      number of determined states. A
                      <b>While Loops</b>
                      requires some element of unpredictability
                      to be interesting (justified).<br><br>

                      I manufacture that here with
                      <b>pseudo random numbers</b>, which are
                      interesting in their own right. You need
                      the <b>random module</b> to access the
                      function <b>randint</b> in this example.
                      <b>randint(a,b)</b> generates and returns
                      a <b>pseudo random number</b>, <b>N</b> say,
                      in the range <b>a <= N <= b</b>.

                      Of course, there are lots of other
                      good things
                      in <b>random</b>, you can list them with
                      command <b>dir(random)</b>. If any
                      particularly
                      catch your eye, you can discover more with,
                      for example, <b>help(random.randint)</b>.
                    </li><br>

                      Here is another example of an over length
                      code line. I use a <b>backslash</b>, you
                      might have
                      preferred to enclose the entirety of that
                      which is to be printed in parentheses,
                      <b>()</b>.

              <hh4>Test at the Bottom (Repeat ... until)

            </span>
          </summary>

            <div class="minsect"><br>

              <p>There is no special syntax for this
                 type of <b>Loop</b>.
                 If you want to implement one, you need to
                 "bend" what <b>Python</b> provides for other
                 forms of <b>Loop</b>.
              </p>

              <p>The easiest way to do this is to use a
                 <b>While loop</b> with a
                 <i>&lt;Conditional</i>&gt;
                 that always evaluates to <b>True</b>. That is a
                 <b>While Loop</b> that, it left to its
                 own devices,
                 would continue to <b>Loop</b> forever!
              </p>

              <p>In addition, an explicit
                 <i>&lt;Conditional</i>&gt;
                 is added at the end of the <b>Loop</b>
                 to detect the
                 appropriate moment to leave.
              </p>

              <p>The <b>Python command break</b> is used
                 to request the
                 jump out of the <b>Loop</b>'s natural
                 inclination for perpetual revolution.
              </p>

              <p>Not particularly pretty, but it works fine
                 and looks something like the following:<br>

                 <div class="code">
                   While True<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 1<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 2<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 3<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 4<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                   ...<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if
                   <span style="font-weight:normal;">
                     <i>&lt;Conditional</i>&gt;:
                   </span> break<br>
                 </div>
              </p>

              <p class="hint"><b>Note</b>: Concerning
                 <i>&lt;Conditional</i>&gt;s that always return
                 the value "<b>True</b>".<br><br>

                 <b>Python</b> includes the <b>Class bool</b>.
                 An object
                 of the <b>Class bool</b> may take one of
                 two values,
                 <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.<br><br>

                 <b>Python</b> offers the two
                 "<b>Built in</b>" constants,
                 <b>True</b> (set to the <b>bool value True</b>)
                 and <b>False</b> (set to the <b>bool
                 value False</b>).<br><br>

                 These constants can be used to refer to the
                 two possible <b>bool</b> values in your code.
                 For example:<br><br>

                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>while
                 True</b><br><br>

                 which feels like a nice way to make
                 the everlasting <b>loop</b>
                 required to me?<br><br>

                 Things are actually more flexible
                 than the discussion
                 so far implies.The <b>Class bool</b>
                 is a <b>Subclass</b>
                 of the <b>Class Integer</b>. That is to say,
                 the values
                 <b>True</b> and <b>False</b> are really
                 <b>Integers</b>
                 at some level
                 (<b>1</b> and <b>0</b> respectively). Therefore,
                 it is logical that
                 everywhere you could use <b>True</b>,
                 you could also
                 use <b>1</b>. So:<br><br>

                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>while 1</b><br><br>

                 would meet the current needs, if with a large
                 slice of avoidable enigma!<br><br>

                 If you like, it is OK to think of <b>True</b>
                 and <b>1</b>
                 as "the same". That works. <b>But it is not
                 true</b>! Maybe to get a feel for the
                 differences, try
                 throwing the following at the <b>Python
                 Interpreter</b> (one at a time!):<br><br>

                 <b>True False 6==6 6==7 True-1 False+3</b>
                 ... and similar<br><br>

                 If this makes things clear, Jolly Good. If not,
                 then just
                 believe <b>True</b> is the same as <b>1</b>
                 and <b>False</b>
                 and <b>0</b> are equivalents (but not near
                 me!).<br><br>

                 Finally, and to summarise, you can use either
                 a <b>boolean expression</b> (e.g. "<b>6==6</b>",
                 "<b>3>9</b>") or an
                 <b>Integer expression</b> (e.g.
                 <b>"94*(3-4)"</b>) for
                 the <b>while loop</b>
                 <i>&lt;Conditional</i>&gt;.<br><br>

                 If you use an <b>Integer expression</b>,
                 a result
                 of <b>0</b> is <b>False</b>, any other
                 result is <b>True</b>. You can test
                 this assertion
                 by presenting the <b>Python Interpreter</b> with
                 numbers given as <b>Arguments</b> to the
                 <b>Built in
                 Function bool</b>. <b>bool</b> takes a
                 <b>Numeric
                 Parameter</b> and returns the appropriate
                 <b>boolean</b> value. For example, try the
                 <b>Interpreter</b> with such as:<br><br>

                 <b>bool(-2) bool(-1) bool(0) bool(0.99) bool(1)
                 bool(1.001) bool(2) bool(3) ...</b><br>
              </p>

                Well, you could argue you do not need a <b>Loop</b>
                of any description?<br><br>

                This would work fine:<br><br>

                But the code is very clumsy and repetitive,
                even when counting <b>Base Pairs</b>,
                of which there are
                but <b>4</b> types.<br><br>

                Imagine how horrible the code would appear for

                The proper code solution is to use a simple

                      <i>&lt;Step&gt</i><b>);</b><br><br>

                <b>range</b> returns a <i>&lt;List&gt</i>,
                the first element of which is the <b>Value</b>
                of <i>&lt;Start&gt;</i> and the last element
                of which is <b><u><i>one less than</u></i></b>
                the value of <i>&lt;Stop&lt</i>.<br><br>

                Each <b>List</b> element (after the first)
                is the previous element incremented by
                <i>&lt;Step&gt</i>.<br><br>

                The parameter <i>&lt;Step&gt;</i> may be
                omitted (as it was in this <b>Example</b>), in
                which case the value <b>1</b> is assumed.
                <b>List</b> elements are always exactly
                <b>1</b> larger than their predecessor.<br><br>

              The <b>Python open Function</b> returns a
              "<b>File Handle</b>" (fancy name for something
              that points to the contents of the file that has
              just been read).<br><br>

              In <b>Python</b>, a file handle can be regarded
              as <b>List</b> of the lines of the file,
              in the order in which they are read.<br><br>

              This is extremely convenient here! It means that
              the <b>File Handle</b> (<b>Sequence_file</b>)
              can be used directly as the <b>Loop</b > control
              &lt;<i>List</i>&gt; for looking at the <b>File
              homeobox_human.fasta</b> line by line.<br><br>

              Leaving <b>open</b> files around, even when empty,
              is not good practice. They should be neatly
              <b>closed</b>, as here. It is all too easy to
              forget to do this!<br><br>

             might make that seem a little redundant.

          <p>Why not include your <b>pseudo-code</b> in your
             <b>Python Script</b> as a comment?
          </p>

          <p>Be sure to comment your
             <b>Python Code</b> liberally and to, wherever
             possible, use <b>Variable Names</b> that
             relate to their use.

          <p><b>Code Annotation</b> is vital if you wish to

              <b>Part (i)</b><br><br>

              Download the file
                 <a href="../Data/reads.fastq"
                  target="_blank"> <b>reads.fastq</b></a>,
                       and put it in your <b>Current Working
                       Directory</b>.<br><br>

              This is a very very small <b>fastq</b> file.<br><br>

              I will assume you have all, at least, heard of
              <b>fastq</b> files?.<br><br>

              <b>fastq</b> is a file format for <b>H</b>igh
              <b>T</b>hroughput <b>S</b>equencing
              (<b>HTS</b>) reads,
              usually each fastq file will contain
              millions of reads.<br>

              If you wish to know more about this format,
              we offer a short video outlining the
              wonders of the
              <b>fastq Format</b> and related issues.<br>

              <details class="video">

              However, all you <b><u><i>need</i></u></b> to
              know about this format to do this exercise is;<br>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Each <b>read</b> uses <b>4</b>
                  lines of the file
                </li>

                <li>
                  The first line of each read is the
                  <b>Annotation</b> line and begins with
                  a "<b>@</b>"
                </li>
              </ol><br>

              <b>Part (ii)</b><br>

              <p>Write code to read in the file
              <b>reads.fastq</b> one line at a time and
              then print out only the sequence
              <b>Annotation Lines</b>
              (the ones that start with a '<b>@</b>'.<br><br>

              When the entire file is read, print out the
              number of <b>Reads</b> its contained.<br>

              Using the <b>Python</b> command <b>break</b>,

              It is safe to assume that the reads are

      <h2><u>SYNTAX for Python User Defined Functions</u></h2>

      <p><b>Python</b> offers a number of
         "<b>Built in</b>" <b>functions</b>.
         For example:
         <ul>
           <li><b>len</b>(<i>&lt;string&gt;</i>) -
               <b>returns</b> the
               <b>length</b> of a
               <b>string argument</b>
           </li>
           <li><b>range(</b><i>&lt;integer&gt;</i>,
                            <i>&lt;integer&gt;</i>,
                            <i>&lt;integer&gt;</i>) -
               <b>returns</b> a <b>list</b> of <b>integers</b>
               defined by the
               three <b>arguments</b> it receives
           </li>
           <li>and many more ...
           </li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The number of available <b>functions</b> is greatly
         expanded by <b>importing modules</b>. For example:
         <ul>
           <li>From the "<b>math</b>" <b>module</b> many
               <b>functions</b> including: <b>cos</b>,
               <b>sin</b>, <b>tan</b>, <b>log</b>,
               <b>log10</b>, <b>radians</b> ...
           </li>
           <li>An overpowering number of mathematical
               <b>functions</b> from the <b>numpy module</b>
               (in the <b>python interpreter</b>, type
               "<b>import numpy</b>" and then
               "<b>dir(numpy)</b>", for the full story).
           </li>
           <li>and many more ...
           </li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <p>But there will always be the instance where the
         exactly appropriate function for a particular user
         need is not available.
      </p>

      <p>The only option is for the user to write that
         which is required him/herself. which is
         really very easy!
      </p>

      <p>The basic syntax is as follows:

      <div class="code">def
         <span style="font-weight:normal;">
         <i>Function_Name</i>
         </span>
         (par1, par2, par3 ...):<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 1<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 2<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 3<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         &nbsp;&nbsp;....<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
      </div>

      <p>
      </p>

      <p>
      </p>

      <p class="hint"><b>Note</b>:
         <i>Function_Name</i> is determined by the user,
         of course;<br><br>

         There may be between <b>none</b> and
         <b>lots</b> of <b>parameters</b>
         ( <b>(par1, par2, par3 ...)</b> ).<br><br>

         There may be between <b>none</b> and
         <b>lots</b> of <b>returns</b>. If <b>none</b>,
         it could be argued that what had been written
         was a <b>User Defined Procedure</b>. Just
         one <b>return</b> at the end of the code is typical.

                  and amend it to cope with many numbers,
                  by allowing your function to receive
                  a variable number of <b>Arguments</b>.<br><br>

                  Maybe you should change the name
                  of the <b>Function</b> whilst
                  you are at it?

                  <p class="hint">{<b><i>Hint</i></b>:
                     To declare a <b>Parameter</b> that
                     can receive multiple <b>Arguments</b>,
                     you simply prepends a "*" to the
                     <b>Parameter</b> name. For example:<br><br>

                     <b>Average (*Numbers):</b><br><br>

                     The <b>Parameter</b> can then be treated as
                     a <b>list</b> within the body of
                     the <b>Function</b>.<br>

                    Look carefully at my solution.<br><br>

                    In the <b>TEST BED Code</b>,

                    <b>print str(AverageN(1 , 2, 4));</b><br><br>

                    and receive the answer:<br><br>

                    <b>2</b><br><br>

                    Ummm? Is that right? Why <b>2</b>?
                    and not <b>2.333333...</b>?<br><br>

                    How could I persuade my code to
                    give me the rather more convincing
                    answer <b>2.3333333...</b>?<br><br>

                  The interesting thing here is that the only
                  change required to convert from a <b>list
                  Argument</b> to a <b>tuple Argument</b> was
                  in the <b>TEST BED Code</b>!<br><br>

                  The <b>Code</b> for the <b>Function</b>
                  remained unedited.<br><br>

                  You already witnessed this in <b>Part(i)</b>
                  of this <b>Example</b>. <b>The Function</b>
                  was sent mixtures of <b>int</b>s and
                  <b>float</b>s with no warning as too what
                  to expect ... and all was well!

                  So a <b>Function</b> is completely
                  promiscuous concerning the type of
                  its <b>Parameters</b>!
                  Anything is accepted.<br><br>

                  Of course, it is not always the case
                  that anything works!
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  Notice the <b>comma</b> added to the end
                  of the last <b>tuple</b> of the
                  <b>tuple</b> of <b>tuples</b>. That is:<br><br>

                  <b>(2.9999,)</b><br><br>

                  Remove this <b>comma</b> and you will
                  get an <b>Error Condition</b>?<br><br>

                  Why do you suppose that is? Why is the
                  trailing <b>comma</b> so important, just
                  in this <b>tuple</b> and none of the others?

                <b>Part (i)</b> (the version with
                <b>Global Scope</b> for the main

                (rather than inside the function).

              <div class="pseudo">
                Very similar to <b>Part (i)</b>. You just need

                Also you need to <b>return</b> the <b>completed

                Add a <b>Parameter</b> to the <b>function</b>

                The new <b>Parameter</b> is to determine

                it can take an integer value of <b>1</b>,

                 "<b>=</b>" sign.

                 In this case, the <b>def</b> line for
                 the function might look something like:

                 <b>def rnatoaa(rna, Reading_Frame = 1):</b>

                 <b>rna</b> is a <b>Required Parameter</b>,
                 for it to be omitted would be an <b>Error</b>.

                 <b>Reading_Frame</b> is an <b>Optional

              An "advanced" challenge for those finding
              things all too easy!<br><br>

              Write a <b>Recursive Function</b> that returns
              the <b>nth</b> <b>Fibonacci Number</b>.<br><br>

              <p class="hint">{<b><i>Hint</i></b>:
                 A <b>Recursive Function</b> is one that
                 calls itself.

                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number"

              If you are now muttering to yourself
              "<b>Recursion</b>? <b>Fibonacci?</b> I do
              not remember discussing these?". Not Fair!<br><br>

              Then ... yes indeed, that is about right.

              </summary>
                <div class="answer">
                  My first answer is:
                  <a href="../Solutions-Python/Loops_5iia.txt"
                   target="_blank"> <b>Loops_5iia.txt</b></a><br>

                  Just build a loop to use the <b>Function</b>
                  you used in the previous section,
                  over and over.<br><br>

                  This works and is easy to read BUT ...
                  just think of the masses of computation you
                  are doing over and over again!!! Also, the
                  huge number of function calls, which are
                  a serious overhead. This approach
                  can be exceedingly inefficient!<br><br>

                  This is a common feature of recursive solutions.
                  They can be beautifully simple and
                  conceptually appealing.
                  They can also be grossly inefficient!<br><br>

                  Computers are so fast these days that people
                  rarely fuss about efficiency.
                  It is thought preferable to simply update
                  the computer to something that is so fast
                  it will not notice your poor code!!<br><br>

                  I disapprove! I am old! The level of
                  waste of computer effort here is as such
                  a level to preclude sleep!<br><br>

                  Accordingly, I offer a second solution
                  that does not use recursion. A dried up
                  withered thing that
                  has no poetry, but will run lots and
                  lots faster.<br><br>

                  My second answer is:
                   <a href="../Solutions-Python/Loops_5iib.txt"
                      target="_blank"> <b>Loops_5iib.txt</b></a><br>

                  Whilst this is much faster than the
                  original (in particular it makes only
                  one function call per <b>Fibonacci
                  Number</b>),
                  it still wastefully repeats many
                  computations over and over.<br><br>

                  Another Version! This time, change
                  the specification for the
                  <b>Function</b>.<br><br>

                  The specification is amended to print
                  the entire series as it calculates the
                  terms, <b><i><u>JUST ONCE</u></i></b>,
                  up to and including the <b>Argument</b>
                  it is provided for the
                  <b>Parameter n</b>.<br><br>

                  This is the best solution by far!<br><br>

                  The third answer is:
                  <a href="../Solutions-Python/Loops_5iic.txt"
                   target="_blank"> <b>Loops_5iic.txt</b></a><br>

                  Just for fun, I time the <b>3</b>
                  solutions when asked to print out the
                  first <b>1000</b> elements of the
                  <b>Fibonacci Series</b>.<br><br>

                  I had to give up on the <b>Recursive</b>
                  version as it was taking too long!
                  I compromised by asking for only
                  <b>50</b> terms from the recursive
                  solution and <b>1000</b> from the
                  other two.<br><br>

                  The results were even more extreme than I
                  expected! I need to make sure I have tested
                  fairly and accurately, but here are the
                  results as of now:<br><br>

                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Version 1</b>, Recursion, function
                      returning a single Series term.<br><br>
                      <b>171m46.585s</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      {<b>for just 50 terms!</b>}
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Version 2</b>, Iterative,
                      function returning
                      a single Series term.<br><br>
                      <b>000m0.062s</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      {for 1000 terms}
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Version 3</b>, Iterative,
                      function printing
                      all the terms to a given point in a
                      single call.<br><br>
                      <b>000m0.015s</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      {for 1000 terms}
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  The point is made? <b>Recursion</b> has
                  its place, but needs to be used with
                  caution. Such is my conclusion.<br><br>

                  Finally, the third version answer here does
                  not return a <b>Fibonacci Number</b>
                  as a variable?
                  Is it therefore <b>Procedure</b>?<br><br>

                  A pedant might argue for such a ruling,
                  except! --- a value is returned. The
                  <b>Function</b> returns an error code
                  (<b>true</b> for
                  success, <b>false</b> for failure).<br><br>

                  Many <b>Callable Units</b> that look
                  a bit like
                  <b>Procedures</b> at the level of
                  the <b>Algorithm</b>,
                  use their apparently redundant values to
                  report success status. In doing so, they
                  become indisputably, <b>Functions</b>.<br><br>

                <b>Alois</b> offers you some simple definitions,
                I offer you an <b>analogy to reinforce

                <b>========================================</b><br><br>

                Long long ago, in a land called Warminster,
                lived my fine father, my beautiful mother,
                my idiot sister and my inestimable self.<br><br>

                In our garden, we had a huge walnut tree,
                which was only truly functional for the
                minute part of the year (September/October)
                when it provided us (generously) with walnuts.<br><br>

                The rest of the year it simply stood around
                and prevented the warm caress of the sun from
                assisting the things planted in our garden in
                their attempts to evade the well meant
                attentions of my dear father.<br><br>
              
                Particularly during its leaf incontinent
                moments of Autumn, this magnificent walnut
                generator exercised my father to some
                significant degree! He would address the
                tree with vigorous military gesture and
                expressions which I fear I am far to well
                bred to share with you, in the particular.<br><br>
                
                Suffice it to note, his general theme was
                that it was, solely, the responsibility of
                the walnut tree that nothing but spinach
                (oh ... the spinach! why the spinach ...)
                would grow in his garden.<br><br>
                  
                The tree was unmoved and never interrupted
                its life consuming study of the
                heavens and their message for the chosen
                genus, "Tree".<br><br>
 
                Exasperated, my father would explain to the
                majestic organism, that, had they met in
                "the desert" (where my father spent time
                with a merry band of chums lead by a chap
                called "Monty"), he would have been
                inclined to extreme violence involving
                several tanks and something that shed
                explosive items weighing around 25 pounds!<br><br>

                That, of which my father would have
                undoubtedly approved, would have been the
                replacement of the walnut tree with a single
                tiny walnut that could be magically expanded
                only at appropriate times and only to the
                degree appropriate to the moment.<br><br>
                
                So, for example, when our dog (did I not
                mention him? His name was Monty, just like
                the chap in the desert) wished to relieve
                himself, the magic walnut could be expanded
                into a modest stripling, and then back to a
                walnut as Monty (the dog that is) had
                completed his mission and was shaking
                himself free of excess product.<br><br>

                The need for the full tree,
                would be just briefly for walnut harvest time.<br><br>
                 
                My father would be ecstatic, until he noticed
                the garden was still full only of spinach!<br><br>

                <b>THE INTERPRETATION</b><br><br>

                The <b>range object</b> is like the magic walnut.
                Small and inexpensive, in terms of memory at least.<br><br>
             
                With the <b>Builtin function iter()</b>, the walnut
                (<b>range</b>) can be expanded mostly into an
                <b>iterator object</b> (stripling) suitable for
                stepping along with the <b>next() Builtin function</b>
                or <b>method</b> (analogously being watered by Monty
                the dog).<br><br>

                Only if/when necessary (walnut harvest time) need
                the magic walnut (<b>range</b>) be expanded into a
                huge memory hungry <b>list</b> or <b>tuple</b> (walnut tree).<br><br>

                Got it?  Jolly good!<br><br>

                <b>THE END</b><br>
                
                <b>========================================</b><br><br>

Too unclear/undecided ... maybe if I ever find a succinct way to state all this?
But not now.

        <hh6m>Python is extensible and embeddable</hh6m><br><br>
        
        <div>
				      <b><i>Background discussion only</b></i>
				      (possibly to the extent of self indulgence?
				      Needs to be made clearer or deleted?),
				      but mention of the
				      "extensibility" of Python (and to a lesser extent its
				      embeddability) is ubiquitous. I therefore attempt a
				      simple explanation (and probably fail!).<br><br>
				      
				      I found it difficult to find succinct definitions
				      for either of the terms in question. I decide to
				      settle for the following (feel free to suggest improvements):
				      
				      <ul>
				        <li>
								      An Extensible Programming Language
								      is one or which the Base Language Definition is capable
								      of extension, at runtime, particularly by
								      the inclusion of Libraries written in
								      other Languages enabling access
								      to functionality beyond
								      the Host Language.
								      
								      This certainly is possible for Python,
								      where Libraries written in C can be imported
								      into Python programs enabling access
								      to C features not available in Pure Python.
								      
								      The process of 
				      
				      The benefits of Libraries as a source ready
				      written and tested code are obvious.
				      If the code you need has already been written,
				      and is freely available, why write it again?
				      Most Programming languages have some way to
				      share code in this fashion.<br><br>
